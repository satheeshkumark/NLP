About 1752 Humphrey Baker s settlement was the most western of the Virginia frontier .\nJanuary 17 , 1754 Humphrey and Ann had their son , Robert Baker .\nIt can not be proven , but it is thought that he may have been the first white child born on the extreme Virginia frontier which would become Washington Co , VA Humphrey and Ann Baker had the following children 1 .\nThomas Baker was born about 1737 , location unknown , and died September 29 , 1814 , in Estill Co. , Kentucky .\nThomas made his will the day before he died , listing children Jacob Baker ; the heirs of Joseph Baker ; Humphrey Baker ; William Baker ; the heirs of Thomas Baker Jr. ; and daughters , Betsy Nix , Polly Bell , Sally Hubbard , and Caty Baker .\nAt this time it is unknown who the wife or wives of Thomas Baker were .\n2 .\nMary Baker was born about 1739 .\nShe was wounded in the Shawnee Indian attack of 1755 and survived .\n3 .\nJohn Baker was born about 1740-1745 .\nHe was a soldier in Dunmore s War of 1774 from Fincastle Co. in Capt.\nWilliam Campbell Company .\nHe was listed on the Baker settlement records in 1772 with his father , and brothers , Thomas , Robert , and George .\n4 .\nGeorge Baker was born between 1740-1750 and was a soldier in Dunmore s War of 1774 from Fincastle Co , VA in Lt.

BEST .\nHamilton Corinth Press 1991 .\nPp .\nx , 224 , illus .\n$ 32.95 Reviewed by CHARLES M. JOHNSTON Mc Master University This biography is the first serious attempt to do justice to Thomas Baker Mc Questen , the Hamilton native who served as minister of highways and public works in Mitchell F. Hepburn s controversial Liberal administrations at Queen s Park a half century ago .\nAnd as the author , John C. Best , makes abundantly clear , there is considerable justice to be done .\nBut the question immediately arises Why was Mc Questen neglected for so long ?\nOne could speculate that over the years his vindictiveness and remoteness , among other flaws paraded out by an author who commendably points to his subject s warts as well as to his more comely features , may have made Mc Questen a less than appetizing choice for the prospective biographer .\nHe may also have proved unpalatable because of his slavish backing of Hepburn , a political leader whom many condemned as a crude charlatan and a moral fraud , a person hardly fit to be supported by a scion of a leading Hamilton family noted for its devotion to the finer aesthetic things of life .\nAgain , it may simply have been a matter of a Grit s being considered less than historically worthy and politically correct in the heavy Tory atmosphere that prevailed in Ontario after the Second World War .\nTo add to Mc Questen s liabilities , not only did he fail to win the Liberal leadership after Hepburn withdrew from the scene , but his own parliamentary career at Queen s Park came to an abrupt end in the 1945 elections that produced George Drew s majority Conservative government .\nAt least in the political sense Mc Questen ended up as an apparent loser , not exactly a front-burner subject for the aspiring student of politics .\nThankfully , none of this deterred Best , who has performed an important rescue operation for Mc Questen and , in the process , put together a good read , as one might expect from a perceptive news executive who plies his trade at a local television station .\nI would put his book in the same league with Neil Mc Kenty s equally lively biography of Hepburn , which appeared a quarter-century ago .\nBest examines Mc Questen s political career at both the local and provincial levels , from his aldermanic responsibilities in Hamilton to the organization of Liberal affairs in the city and the province , and final-ly to his elevation to Hepburn s cabinet after the Grit sweep to power in 1934 .\nThe author is at pains to point out that politics for Mc Questen was only a means to an end , an opportunity to acquire the necessary authority and funding to promote his many brain children , including the Queen Elizabeth Way that opened in 1939 .\nThe highways minister , we are told , was disposed to overlook Hepburn s many blemishes on the grounds that the premier constituted the only hope for safeguarding Liberal fortunes in the province and hence for furnishing the necessary springboard for Mc Questen s own cherished projects to beautify the Ontario cityscape and modernize its highway network .\nWas he playing the role of a local Albert Speer ?\nThe argument , however , is only partially convincing .\nFor all his gentility and supposed aloofness from the political rough-and-tumble , Mc Questen appears to have entered fully into the in-fighting that frequently disfigured Liberal affairs in Ontario and to have played a major role in the bargaining that led to the selection of party officials and candidates .\nHe also shared Hepburn s cordial loathing for Mackenzie King , so much so that he saw to it that the prime minister s name did not appear on a commemorative bell lodged in another of his inspirations , the Rainbow Bridge carillon at Niagara Falls .\nIn any case , there is no question that the most compelling sections of the book do in fact deal with Mc Questen s varied beautification schemes .\nHe sought to enhance urban approaches like Hamilton s northwestern entrance and to provide ample and ornamental park space for blighted industrial communities .\nHe also oversaw the construction of an imaginatively landscaped version of an Autobahn - the aforementioned QEW - chaired the work of the Niagara Parks Commission , and inspired the planting of floral oases such as the Royal Botanical Gardens in Hamilton .\nThe last would not only provide splendid vistas for a citizenry habitually starved of such amenities but ultimately a botanical laboratory for major research .\nAs Best demonstrates , Mc Questen came by all this honestly .\nIn the early years of the century he had become infatuated with the international City Beautiful movement and had welcomed ambitious urban planning schemes drafted by outside experts such as Noulan Cauchon , all of which shaped his thinking when he became head of Hamilton s Board of Park Management and later the minister of highways .\nThe author rightly gives full marks to Mc Questen s strong commitment to parks as arcadian retreats and environmental lungs , even if much of his imaginative enterprise smacks of the patrician stooping to conquer .\nHis otherwise laudable schemes for the multitude might also have been an exercise in what passes for social control , particularly in an age ravaged by a crippling depression and stirred by unsettling ideologies of the left - always anathema to him and his circle .\nAgain , it is ironic , though typical of his class and generation , that while the college-educated Mc Questen played a vital role in locating Mc Master University in Hamilton - ` the first break in a broader culture for the city , as he characteristically put it 58 - he was quick to suspect professors of being in cahoots with dangerous revolutionaries bent on destroying the world that he held dear .\nFor Mc Questen the latter included ` On-to - Ottawa hunger marchers and those who instigated the bitter CIO strike at the General Motors plant in Oshawa .\nThis attractively designed and well-illustrated biography is not only readable but scholarly .\nFamily papers , a wide assortment of archival materials , and a variety of newspapers , magazines , and printed memoirs have been assiduously recruited and deployed to produce an enlightening piece of work .\nAll the same , some of the entries on secondary sources are too sparse no chapter or page references , for example , and there are some inexplicable bibliographical omissions to name but one , John Weaver s history of Hamilton , which could have provided helpful and corrective insights .\nAnd when dealing with political matters Best sometimes confuses an already complicated picture by failing to introduce properly on first mention some of the leading players - for example , Harry C. Nixon 90 , who beat out Mc Questen for the Grit leadership after Hepburn stepped down .\nMore seriously , he gives insufficient credit to the road-builders who came before Mc Questen , notably Wentworth s expansive agribusinessman , Frank Campbell Biggs , who had served in E. C. Drury s ill-fated Farmers government in the early 1920s .\nBut these are comparatively minor criticisms of a welcome study that will clearly benefit students of Ontario politics , urban enhancement , and regional history .\nThomas Baker Mc Questen Public Works , Politics , and Imagination . by Charles\nM.

'Early History of the George Baker Family of Bennington Co. . VT , and Otsego Co. , NY EARLY HISTORY OF THE GEORGE BAKER FAMILY OF BENNINGTON CO. , VT. , AND OTSEGO CO. , N. Y.\nCompiled by Zervia Barnes Birdsall and Mildred Birdsall Covert 1908-1912 George Baker was one of the pioneer settlers of Pownal , Vermont .\nThis place was first settled by the Dutch in 1724 , but the town government was not organized until 1763 , when the town was named in honor of Thomas Pownal , governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony , 1757-1760 .\nIt formed part of the territory know as the New Hampshire Grants , over which there was so much trouble with New York , as that colony claimed the land which really belonged to the New England territory .\nThe first known reference to George Baker contained in early records is found on page 283 , Vol .\nI , Vermont Historical Society Collection , where his name appears , with other residents of Pownal , as one of the signers of a petition to the King , dated Nov. 1766 , in which the King is requested to restrain the New York colonists from further encroachments on the New Hampshire Grants .\nPrior to 1766 nothing is positively known concerning George Baker but it is believed that he was born in Massachusetts about 1730 .\nSome papers belonging to Leroy Baker of Osceola , Tioga Co. , Pa. , record statements made by Chauncey Baker son of George , whose father was Daniel Baker to the effect that Daniel s father , George Baker of Pownal , Vt. , came to this country with two brothers , one of whom was Col. William Henry Baker .\nBut as no other record to substantiate this has been found , it seems more probable that he was a descendant of Edward Baker of Lynn , Mass. , who was a freeman of that town in 1638 and who died there in 1687 .\nThe New England Genealogical and antiquarian Register , Vol .\nV , p. 190 , contains considerable data concerning this family , in substance as follows It is known that this Edward Baker had five sons , possibly more - Joseph and Timothy of Northampton , Edward and Thomas of Lynn , and John of Dedham .\nTimothy was the leading character of Northampton .\nHe had five children , John 1680 , Thomas 1682 , Edward 1685 , Prudence 1687 , Deliverance 1689 .\nThe oldest son , John , Capt.\nJohn Baker , lived on the old homestead in Northampton and was one of the most influential men of the town .\nHe had seven sons , John , Noah , Aaron , Elisha , Stephen , Timothy , Elijah , and two daughters .\nAll the sons except Timothy , who died while on the expedition against Louisburg , married and settled in western Massachusetts ; all lived to be 80 years old or over , and all left numerous families whose descendants are all over the United States from Vermont to Texas .\nPerhaps George Baker was son 2 one of the younger sons of Thomas or Edward , sons of Timothy Baker of Northampton , or it may be that his father was one of the other sons of John Baker who was the oldest son of Timothy .\nThe early records of Pownal town give the following data about George Baker and some of his family .\nIn the earlier records the name is spelled Bacor , but afterwards Baker .\n1 There were six school districts in Pownal in the early days , and the fifth district is described as follows Beginning at John Matison s north to George Bacor s , thence to Bennington line , going east on the First District , all to be one district .\n2 A deed given by George Gardner to Benjamin Gardiner , recorded in Vol .\nII of the town records gives one boundry as follows thence running to the old fence now standing where George Bacor once lived .\nThis deed is dated the 22nd day of February in the 15th year of His Majestie s reign , that is Feb. 22 , 1775 , as George III became King in 1760 .\nThe clause where George BAcor once lived is significant as it proves that he had changed his place of residence in Pownal prior to 1775 .\n3 Vol .\nII of the records contains several lists of Pownal freemen and of those who took the freeman s oath for the first time in certain years .\nThe list of those resident in 1773 include George Baker and the same list records Joseph Briggs , afterwards Capt.\nBriggs , and many others who were in Briggs company with George Baker and Daniel Baker , in service of the United States during the Revolution .\nThe list of those who took the freeman s oath in 1782 , all of whom must have been 21 years old or over , gives Daniel Baker , probably the son of George .\nThis lists in the early records of Pownal are fast becoming illegible and for that reason they are given .\nNames of Freemen of the Town of Pownal , 1773 .\nElder Benjamin Gardner Nathaniel Seeley David Page Peter Robards Stephen Perigo John Lareby Stephen Osborn Charles Wright Richard Weaver Daniel Miers Jeremiah Eldrich Nathan Eldrich Jonothan Oles Benjamin Pratt Samuel Popple Abraham Gardner Silas Watson Rufus Weaver David Gardner Benjamin Card Daniel Phillips JOSEPH BRIGGS John Dunning Samuel Eldrich John Sykes Amos Hungerford Caleb Morgan David Cary William Bates James Philips Benjamin Morgan Daniel Eldrich Benjamin Briggs Micha Briggs Joseph Barber Daniel Card John Aylesworth Job Green Isaac Wholey Joseph Williams , Jr. .

W. part of Pownal , bounded as follows Adjoining west on a lot of land lately owned by Capt.\nBriggs , now the property of Abel Parker , north on a 90 A. lot laid out for the use of schools in Pownal town , east on Francis Bates land , south on the highway north of Jonathan Cards land , containing 45 A. and is the 4th division lot laid out to the right of Nathaniel Phelps , original grantee in said town of Pownal .\nThe price paid was 22 .\n10 s. 5 Vol .\nIII records that November 28 , 1788 , Josiah Bates conveyed to George Bacor for the sum of 2 , a small tract of land adjoining the property he bought of David Page .\n6 Vol .\nV records the transfer of the above properties by George Baker spelling changed in this deed to Benjamin Gardner and Silas Card of Pownal .\nThe total purchase price was $ 900.00 .\nThe date of sale is February 15 , 1798 , and the deed was recorded February 19 , 1798 .\nNo other records of property transfer to or by George Baker occur in Pownal records , and it is supposed that he went to Otsego County , N. Y. , directly after the sale of his Pownal farm .\nThis farm of 45 A. is situated in the hill country a few miles from Pownal Center , in the N. W. part of Pownal township .\nIt is now part of a 350 A. farm owned by Mr. Frank Wilson , but is still called the Baker lot .\nA complete record of all transfers of this property with description of boundries , and other interesting matter , has been compiled and is now in possession of the 4 historian .\nThe place where the old house stood overlooks the highway which led from the Vermont settlements to those near Albany , N. Y.\nLooking to the south one gets a beautiful view of Greylock , the most famous of the Berkshire Hills , and it is worthwhile to remember that George Baker and his family , sturdy pioneers living there so many years ago , looked daily upon a landscape which is now one of the most famous in all New England .\n7 Vol .\nIII records the purchase of property by Wm.\nBacor , possibly a son of George , who bought 25 A. of William and Gardner Hall July 10 , 1794 , the price being 40 .\nIn 1798 Wm.\nBaker sold this land , except a small tract containing a mill , and in 1799 he sold the mill with its surrounding plot .\nNo further records of property owned by Wm.\nBaker appear in the Pownal records .\nHe probably went to New York State , perhaps to Otsego County .\nAccording to tradition he afterward went to Philadelphia and became very wealthy .\n8 The first census of Vermont , taken in 1790 , records George Baker as follows George Baker , Pownal Town , free white males of 16 years and upwards , including heads of families , one ; free white males under 16 years , two ; free white females including heads of families , three ; no other persons , no slaves .\nThis means that in 1790 there were only four children at home , two boys under sixteen , probably Joseph and Stephen , and two daughters , Asa and Susan .\n9 The Vermont Revolutionary Rolls , p. 88 , record George Baker and Daniel Baker as having served in the company of Capt.\nJoseph Briggs from October 1 , 1778 - November 24 , 1778 .\nThe Vermont records are very incomplete and no known record exists to prove that George Baker took part in the battle of Bennington , but family tradition and abundant proofs of his residence in Vermont , in the vicinity of Bennington , from 1766 to 1798 , make one certain that such service was rendered .\nPerhaps he was a member of Col. Herrick s body of militia or of Capt.\nDewey s company in Col. Brush s militia .\nEgbert Baker of Harpursville , who died in 1908 , had the powder horn which , according to tradition , was carried by George Baker in this battle .\nEgbert received it from his father Reed , son of Thomas , to whom it was given by his Reed s grandfather , George Baker .\nMr. Ezra Stevens , an old resident of Milford , recalls some stories of the Revolution which he heard told by Thomas Baker s children .\nHe says that George Baker and three of his sons were at Bennington battle and that Thomas , who was but a lad , went with his father s team to help clear the slain from the field .\nThe records in possession of Leroy Baker see p. 1 also state that George 5 Baker and three of his sons were soldiers in the Revolution .\nMr. Stevens says that one of the older sons , Abel Aylesworth Baker , was a colonel in the Colonial army .\nEzra Stevens father , William Stevens , came to Otsego County in 1784 , and lived for many years near Schuyler Lake .\nWhen he went to live in the town of Milford in 1798 , some of the Bakers were there and it is supposed they came in the early 90 s , perhaps in 1792 .\nThe first recorded deed of property owned by the family is that of the Thomas Baker farm , 108 A. from the Otego patent , purchased in December , 1794 of William Temple Franklin , through his agent , William Cooper .\nThe price paid was 119 .\n4s .\n9d .\nSince 1794 this farm , near Milford , N. Y. , has been owned by some member of the Thomas Baker family .\nIt is now the home of Ralph Baker , son of Warren L. , whose father was Leonard , son of Thomas , son of George Baker of Pownal .\nEdward Baker s farm was also from the Otego patent , bought of Thomas Mumford in November 1796 , 46 A. , for 130 .\n19s 8d .\nThe first recorded deed of property owned by George Baker in Otsego County was placed on file March 18 , 1819 , though the farm was purchased in 1812 .\nIt contained 102 A. and was distinguished as farm , or subdivision B of lot No. .\n45 in the 13000 , A. of land , on a branch of the Susquehanna River and Cherry Valley Creek , granted by letters patent to Volkert Outhoudt and six others .\nIt is probable that George Baker lived on this farm , some years before he owned it .\nThe farm was purchased of the executors of Catherin Lawrence of New York City and the sum paid for it was $ 612.00 of good and lawful money of the United States .\nThe descriptions and legal terms of the old-time deeds differ from those of today , and as a matter of interest and as something of a curiosity , the following quotation from the deed of the property to George Baker is given Folio s p. 78 - Records of Conveyances , Otsego County , N.

Lawrence , Executor R. Watts , Jr. , Executor S. N. Bayard , Executor J. W. Patterson , Executor Witness for identity of men , Daniel Ryan appeared Feb. 24 , 1812 before P. J. Hildreth , Master in Chacery Recorded March 18 , 1819 , 2 o clock p.m. 7 Immediately following the record of this deed , the transfer of this farm , March 17 , 1819 by George Baker and Elizabeth , his wife , to their son Stephen , is recorded , the date of record being March 18 , 1819 , when George Baker appeared before John Russel , Judge of Common Pleas , and acknowledged the deed .\nThe farm remained in Stephen s possession and he lived there until his death , February 13 , 1831 .\nAfter Stephen s death his son Daniel had the farm until February , 1832 , when it was sold by him , ad administrator , to Moses and Ester Chidester of Milford .\nFrom time to time the Chidisters sold portions of the farm until only 77 A. remained of the original 102 A.\nThis remaining plot changed hands several times and March 23 , 1868 , it became the property of Edward Seeger who paid $ 6000 for it .\nIn 1870 he sold two lots , one of 10 A. and one of 8 A. , and in November 1876 , the remaining 59 A. were deeded to his son Dudley Seeger , who son Levant , now owns what remains intact of the farm George Baker purchased in 1812 .\nThe historian has a complete record of all transfers of this farm from 1812-1912 .\nThe house in which Mr. Seeger lives was built by Stephen Baker , but several changes from the original plan have been made since Edward Seeger became the owner .\nOriginally there were two large fireplaces .\nThese have been removed , though the foundation of the great chimney , about 12 feet square , is still standing in the cellar .\nIt was impossible to remove this , as the whole structure rests upon it .\nThe house is very desirably located on a gently sloping hill on the west bank of the Susquehanna River .\nThe view from any point is attractive .\nThe winding river merging into Goodyear Lake , the thickly wooded hills that bound the valley , the uplands from the flats occupied by prosperous farmers whose homes are most inviting , and just to the south , the little church at Milford Center with its white spire above the clustering maples , a landmark of historic prominence - all this and much more makes the old homestead seem a goodly heritage and one is glad to recall the valley as a place toward the settlement of which one s ancestors contributed both labor and capital .\nIt is interesting to know that the site of the first school house in the town of Milford 1794 was on the George Baker farm .\nIn this log school house , which stood a short distance to the north of the Baker homestead , the Baptist church of Milford Center was organized by Rev.\nJosiah Morris , March 13 and 14 , 1805 .\nGeorge Baker lived to be a very old man .\nA Mr. Rowland of Milford , who died several years ago at 90 some years of age , told Alfred Baker of Laurens , 8 1819 , when he acknowledged the deed of his farm to his son Stephen , and November 8 , 1819 , when Mr. Stevens was born .\nThe vital statistics were poorly kept during the early days of Pownal and they contain no record of the marriage of Geoge Baker or of the birth of any of his children .\nIt is supposed that he married Polly Brown , perhaps about 1756 , and that they had ten children , as followes Abel , Daniel 1760 ? , William , Charles , Edward 1766 ? , Thomas 1768 , Asa a daughter , Joseph , Stephen 177 Susan .\nIt is possible that the wife , Polly , died , before George Baker left Vermont ; indeed that may have been the reason for his disposing of his Pownal farm in 1798 and going to New York State , where several of his children had already established homes .\nThe deed of the Otsego County farm to the son Stephen in 1819 is executed by George Baker and Elizabeth his wife , but the last name of the second wife is still unknown .\nNine of George Baker s children married , and it is positively known that Daniel , Edward , Thomas , Joseph and Stephen came to Otsego County , N. Y.\nProbably Asa and William were for a time in Otsego county .\nThe following information concerning the ten children mentioned above is of interest to all descendants of George Baker 1 ABEL BAKER .\nThe records of Seneca County , N. Y. , under date of March 10 , 1832 , give Abel Baker as a resident of the town of Owasco , County of Cayuga and record the sale by him of some Seneca County property .\nThe deed is witnessed by Elisha Baker .\nIn the Cayuga records , the first entry under Abel Baker , April 23 , 1822 , records him as paying $ 1,000 for a portion of lot No. .\n38 in the town of Sempronius .\nVarious other records follow which Abel Baker and Aurora Baker , his wife , transfer parts of this plot in lot No. .\n38 , receiving in all much more than was paid for it .\nIf the family records are true in respect to George Baker s son Abel going out Seneca County way , the entries mentioned must refer to him , as no other Abel Baker is given in Seneca or Cayuga records prior to or from 1822 to 1832 .\nNewell and Lorenzo Baker of Seneca County , grandsons of Abel Baker , were in the Civil War with Harrison T. Baker , son of Russel , son of Thomas of Milford , N. Y.\n2 DANIEL BAKER .\nThe town records of Pownal , Vermont record Daniel Baker as having taken the Freeman s oath in 1782 , so he must have been at least 21 years old at that time .\nHe is known to be one of George Baker s older children and it is probable that he was in the Revolutionary War with his father On p. 88 of the Vermont Rolls a Daniel Baker is recorded as having served in Capt.\nJoseph Brigg s company from October 1 , 1778 to November 24 , 1778 , the same company and service as that of George Baker .\nFamily tradition has it .\n9 some of George s children came to Otsego Co. several years before he did .\nChauncey Baker states , in the records which Leroy Baker has , that Daniel came to Laurens , N. Y. when his son George was about 10 years old , or about 1799 , but is seems probable that he came earlier than that .\nPossibly the Daniel Baker recorded in the first census 1790 as a resident of Otsego town , Montgomery County , N. Y. , is this Daniel Baker .\nThe following is given concerning him Free white males over 16 years , two ; free white males under 16 years , two ; free white females , three .\nThe first recorded ded of property owned by Daniel Baker is that which conveyed to him in 1800 a 50 A. plot in Otsego County , in Lot No. .\n45 of the Otego patent , granted to Thomas Wharton and others .\nDaniel Baker s estate at the time of his death comprised several hundred acres , as there are records showing that his son George bought of Daniel Baker s heirs 1 100 A.\nMarch 8 , 1813 ; 2 of Nathan Baker and his wife Hannah , 100 A. of land belonging to the estate of Daniel Baker , and a little late 3 50 A. more , July 17 , 1819 ; also 100 A. of Benjamin Howe and wife , the plot being described as part of the lot belonging to the heirs of Daniel Baker .\nIn December 1822 James Green and Asa Baker Green , his wife , signed over their claim to her brother George , which leads one to conclude that George Baker , son of Daniel , may have acquired title to all of his father s property .\nThese records establish the fact that Daniel Baker must have died between the year 1800 when he purchased the 50 A. plot and March 8 , 1813 , when the first sale of property belonging to the heirs of Daniel Baker is recorded .\nHis wife survived him many years .\nThe county records state under date of May 25 , 1830 , that Susannah , wife of Daniel Baker , deceased of Laurens , deeded to George Baker a 100 A. lot .\nEarly family records give the name of Daniel s wife as Anna Cumins ; either he was twice married or the name Anna was short for Susannah .\n\\* Daniel Baker had ten children Nathan b.\n1785 , m.

From 1773 to 1903 by EZRA STEVENS George Baker s Family George Baker of Bennington , was the next settler at Milford Center .\nHe came in 1785 , purchased a farm just north of Mr. Mumford s large purchase , which is owned occupied by Dudley Segar at present .\nMr. Baker had seven sons two daughters .\nHis sons names were Abel , Daniel , Charles , Thomas , Edward , Joseph , Stephen .\nHis daughters names were Asie Susan .\nMr. Baker sold his farm in Vermont , when he removed to Milford , there was $ 500 remaining unpaid on it .\nHe sent his oldest son , Col. Abel to Vermont for the money .\nHe collected the money that was the last ever heard of him .\nIt was believed by some that he skipped with the money ; by others that he was robbed murdered .\nAt all events he was never heard from after he received the money .\nMr. Baker s 4th son Thomas married Sarah Morton located at Edson Corners .\nEdward married Hannah Mumford .\nCharles , Stephen Joseph all married raised large families .\nDaniel married Susannah Anna Cumins .\nCharles , Stephen , and Joseph all married and raised large families and located in different towns .\nEdward Baker s oldest son , George left home and went to New York in 1830 and never returned to Milford .\nHe remained in the city and when the T ______ cholery broke out in 1832 , it was supposed he was one of the subjects for he was never heard from after .\nHis daughter Linda and his youngest son , Mumford Baker , removed to Pennsylvania .\nBoth married and never returned to Milford .\nGeorge , Daniel s son , married and settled in Laurens .\nStephen remained on his father s farm in Milford Center until his death .\nHe had one son Daniel who married Nancy Keyes , sold the old farm that was first settled by his grandfather and returned to Laurens .\nThe following served in the Northern Division under Arnold , Gates , and Stark Col. Abel Baker , major Gidean Marlette , Privates George Baker , Daniel Baker , Charles Baker , Artemas Ward , James Frasier , James Westcott , Lemuel Lilly .\nGeorge Baker and his three sons Abel , Daniel , and Charles , and Judah Waters , and Jacob Wellman participated in the battle of Bunker Hill , and afterwards Abel Baker , Judah Waters , and Jacob Wellman were transferred to the regular army under General Washington .\nBiographical History of the Baker Family George Baker , the senior of the Baker family , was born in England before 1600 , and was persecuted for his religious proclivities ; consequently , he took refuge in Holland .\nHe joined the Puritans and embarked in the Mayflower , with the Pilgrims and came to America , and landed at Plymouth in 1620 .\nMr. Baker , afterwards , settled near Boston , Massachusetts .\nI think that George Baker. , the first Baker that settled in Milford was a grandson of the Baker that came from England .\nGeorge Baker , of the first Milford , one of the settlers , was at Concord , Lexington , and Bunker Hill .\nAt the battle of Bunker Hill , his three oldest sons , participated with their father in the fight .\nHis sons names were Abel , Daniel , and Charles .\nAbel was promoted to the office of Colonel and after was under Washington in the main Army .\nIt is stated in an antecedent chapter , that Abel was sent to Bennington by his father to collect a sum of money and that was the last that was heard of him .\nThat was a mistake .\nIt was learned after that he procured the money and with what he had of his own , he went to Philadelphia , and went to speculating and became immensely rich .\nBut he never returned his father s money .\nThe old gentleman , when he 1earned the facts in the case , felt very much grieved over his misconduct towards his father .\nHe was a man that stood high in the community , and little did he think , his son would resort to so comtemptible and outrageous an act as to rob his father of his money , when he had placed confidence in his integrity .\nThe old man felt very much grieved and said he deserved severe punishment .\nThe poor old man had the misfortune to die a horrible death from the effects of a cancer .\nMr. Baker was in the hard fought battle of Bennington , under General Stark , who said , we will win this battle or Mollie Stark will sleep a widow tonight .\nMr. Baker sent for his son Thomas to fetch his horses to carry in the wounded , and disabled soldiers , and tell the people we have killed all the Indians and Tories this side of hell .\n1850 Census - Bainbridge , Chenango County , NY Chauncey Baker age 32 , b.

Baker , a 27 year old clergyman , who was born in Vermont , living in Lancaster , NY and Chauncey Baker age 31 living with his 27 year old wife Emeline in Sodus , NY .\nI then looked for these three Chauncey Bakers in the 1880 census .\nThe 1880 Census index showed four Chauncey Bakers born around the same time .\nThe first was born in Maine and was living in California , definitely not our Chauncey .\nThe second was the Chauncey S. Baker , born in Vermont , and still living in New York State the clergyman from the 1850 Census .\nThe third was a New York born Chauncey Baker living in Antwerp , Michigan with his wife Emmaline obviously the Chaucey from Sodus , NY .\nThe remaining Chauncey was living in Deerfield in Tioga County Pennsylvania .\nHe was 63 years old , born in New York living with a wife named Lucy in the home of his son James Baker aged 28 also born in New York .\nSince this last is obviously the Chauncey Baker who died in 1907 , and we know he was born in Otsego County like our Chauncey , I feel certain that this is probably our ancestor .\nSince our Chauncey was married to an Abigail in 1850 and the Tioga county Chauncey was married to a Lucy , I am guessing that he remarried after Abigail s death sometime between 1850 and 1880 .\nI did not find Chaucey or George Baker in the 1860 Census in either Bainbridge , NY or Shippen , Knoxville , or Deerfield Township , Pennsylvania .\nI did find George Baker aged 24 in the 1870 Bainbridge census .\nI also found Chauncey in the 1900 Census for Shippen in Tioga County , Pennsylvania .\nHe was living with his daughter Libbie A. Schoonover born Feb. 1858 in PA and her husband Chester Schoonover .\nThey were living next door to Charles L Baker born April 1856 in PA and his family .\nI think it is likely that Chauncey and his family moved to Pennsylvania between 1850 and 1856 and that George Baker returned to Bainbridge , NY before 1870 .\nAccording to the Mormon website , George Baker , the father of Chauncey Baker was born in Pownal , Vermont on April 15 , 1789 to Daniel Baker and Susanna Cumins and died on Sept. 25 , 1862 in Laurens , NY .\nHis father Daniel was born around 1760 in Pownal Vermont to another George Baker and Polly Brown .\nDaniel died on March 8 , 1813 in Milford , NY .\nDaniel s father , George Baker is listed as having been born in Massachusetts in 1730 and having died in Milford , NY on November 8 , 1819 .\nI looked up George Baker 1789-1862 in the 1850 1860 Censuses .\nThe 1850 Census shows him age 61 living in Laurens , NY with his wife Susannah age 54 and five children .\nHe is listed as having been born in Vermont and his wife is listed as having been born in New York .\nIn the 1860 Census they are now alone .\nHe is age 71 and she is age 64 .\nThey are both listed as having been born in Connecticut .\nI also found a website at http \\/ \\/ www.rootsweb.com\\/~nyotsego\\/histmil1.htm which is titled EARLY HISTORY OF THE TOWN OF MILFORD AND OTHER PARTS OF OTSEGO CO. . From 1773 to 1903 by EZRA STEVENS .\nIt includes a lot of information about the Baker family and how Daniel and George fought in the Revolutionary war and were among the first settlers of Milford , NY .\nSome of the information is not completely accurate however .\nThey claim the Bakers go back to a George Baker who fled to Holland for religious freedom and then came over on the Mayflower .\nI checked the records and there was no George Baker on the Mayflower .\nPerhaps it was an ancestor by a different name who came on the Mayflower .\nI also doubt that they took part in the battles of Lexington and Concord since they lived in Vermont .\nIf I find anything else , I ll let you know .\nI plan to look for Chauncey in the 1860 1870 censuses and to see if I can find his burial records in Knoxville , PA. . Perhaps I can find Abigail s burial as well .\nWish me luck !\nYour cousin , Tony Research Update 2004.12.24 !\n1860 Census confirms that the Chauncey Baker in Tioga county Pennsylvania and the Chauncey Baker who lived in Bainbridge , New York in 1850 are the one and the same .\nChauncey , his wife Abigail , and their children Eliza , Henry , Erastus , George , Jonathan , Samuel are in both censuses with their ages changed by 10 years as we would expect .\n1860.07.21 Census - Town of Chatham , Tioga County , Pennsylvania , page 121 , lines 15-28 NAME AGE BIRTHPLACE Chauncey Baker 42 NY Abigail 38 Eliza 21 PA Henry 19 NY Erastus 17 George 15 Jonathan 13 Samuel 11 James 9 Susan 7 Mary 5 Charles 4 PA Elizabeth 2 Alford 4\\/12 Links - Rechts Links DNA testing for Baker descendants Y chromosome data about Baker males Ahnentafel of August Georg of Baden - Baden Margrave of Baden - Baden 1761-1771 Descendants of August Georg of Baden - Baden Did his daughter flee to America ?\nAhnentafel of Maria Victoria of Arenberg August Georg of Baden - Baden s wife A brief Biography of August Georg von Baden - Baden Margrave of Baden - Baden 1761-1771 Chronicles of the Croft Family by W.

S. exit from the war , now nearing its fourth year .\nIn an interview on Sunday on ABC - TV , Baker said in his usual manner of lawyerly obfuscation I think it s fair to say our commission believes that there are alternatives between the stated alternatives -- the ones that are out there in the political debate -- of stay the course and cut an run .\nThe phrase cut and run has become the president s favored jibe at Democrats who urge a pullout from Iraq .\nFormer Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton , a Democrat , is co-chairman of the group .\nOne can only hope that its report will have a major impact on the floundering administration , which has to contend with growing American casualties in an unpopular war and rising discontent among its own loyal Republicans in national polls .\nUnfortunately Baker flatly rejected a quick withdrawal from Iraq on grounds that you would see the biggest civil war you ve ever seen .\nWell , what does Baker think is going on in Iraq right now ?\nMeantime , Bush has rejected as just not credible a report of public health researchers that there have been more than 600,000 Iraqi civilian casualties since the U. S. invasion in 2003 .\nBush is seeing some of his own party leaders turning off on the war .\nSen. John Warner , R - Va. . Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , returned from a trip to Iraq last week and said there might have to be a change in course in three months .\nBaker , a skilled Texas political operative , had served as chief of staff in the Reagan administration and as Secretary of the Treasury before becoming the nation s chief diplomat in the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush , father of the president and Baker s close , lifelong friend .\nBaker is well-schooled in Middle Eastern politics .\nIn his 1995 memoir , Baker recalled his 1991 warning not to take Baghdad and topple Saddam Hussein after the successful Persian Gulf War , fearing it would provoke a civil war that would take U. S. forces a long time to quell .\nFor the same reasons , the previous President Bush decided against a full-scale invasion of Iraq after liberating Kuwait .\nBut the current President Bush preferred to take the word of the neocon advisers who told him the invasion of Iraq would be a cakewalk .\nBoth Baker and the senior Bush are vindicated in their view by the on-going chaos in Iraq .\nBut they have not sold the present president , who has indicated the war will go on after he has left office .\nOn Wednesday , Gen. Peter Schoomaker , the Army s chief of staff , said that the army is planning to keep its current level of troops in Iraq through 2010 .\nBaker has come through for Bush in the past , helping to convince the Supreme Court to halt the Florida vote recount in the presidential election in 2000 .\nFor his efforts , a second Bush won the presidency .\nMeantime , U. S. officials in Baghdad and Washington seem bent on trashing the Iraqi government , blaming it for not bringing the aggressive militias under control and indicating Iraqi officials are not up to the job of running the country .\nThat s what I call chutzpah .\nWe invade and tear up a country ; install our style of government in Baghdad and then criticize them for weaknesses and mistakes .\nIs that our passport out of Iraq ?\nWhat s more , those who play ball with us such as Iraqi Vice President Amir al - Hashimi -- who lost three siblings by assassination this year -- pay a heavy personal price .\nIf Baker s group does not find a way to extricate U. S. troops from the Iraqi quagmire , the American people surely will .\nc 2006 Hearst Newspapers -LRB- ! -- div . sociotags clear both ; text-align right ; float right ; div . sociotags div padding-right 4px ; float left ; text-align left ; div . sociotag_header font-weight bold ; div . sociotag_seperator clear both ; height 0px ; div . sociotag a img filter alpha opacity = 50 ; - moz-opacity 0.50 ; opacity 0.50 ; - khtml-opacity 0.50 ; div . sociotag a hover img filter alpha opacity = 99 ; - moz-opacity 0.99 ; opacity 0.99 ; - khtml-opacity 0.99 ; r \\/ \\/ -- -RRB- Spread the Word -LRB- Prev Next -RRB- Back function submitacajoommod var form = document . modacajoom Form ; \\/ \\/ do field validation if form . email . value = = alert Please enter a valid e-mail address .\n; else form . submit ; Subscribe to weekly news , breaking updates and more from News - Press Online Receive HTML ?\n-LRB- ! -- google_ad_client = pub-0939253909571301 ; google_alternate_ad_url = http \\/ \\/ joomla . medspan . info\\/alternate _ ad3 . html ; google_alternate_color = FFFFFF ; google_ad_width = 160 ; google_ad_height = 600 ; google_ad_format = 160x600_as ; google_ad_type = text_image ; google_ad_channel = ; google_color_border = FFFFFF , FFFFFF , FFFFFF , FFFFFF ; google_color_bg = FFFFFF , FFFFFF , FFFFFF , FFFFFF ; google_color_link = 0033 FF , 0033 FF , 0033 FF , 0033 FF ; google_color_url = 008000 , 008000 , 008000 , 008000 ; google_color_text = 333333 , 333333 , 333333 , 333333 ; \\/ \\/ -- -RRB- Today s Weather C 2007 Falls Church News - Press Joomla !\nis Free Software released under the GNU \\/ GPL License .\nSite Powered by Limbo - CMS\n\n',087

DRAPER s ACCOUNT .\nIn his Kings Mountain and Its Heroes , Dr. Draper tells us Ch .\n19 , p. 437 , et seq. .\nthat the Old Fields belonged to Colonel Cleveland , and served , in peaceful times , as a grazing region for his stock , and there his tenant , Jesse Duncan , resided .\nOn Saturday , April 14 , 1881 , accompanied only by a negro servant , Cleveland rode from his Round About plantation on the Yadkin to the Old Fields , where he spent the night .\nCaptain William Riddle , a son of Col. James Riddle of Surry county , both of whom were Royalists , was at that time approaching Old Field from Virginia , with Captain Ross , a Whig captive , and his servant , enroute to Ninety Six , in South Carolina .\nCaptain Riddle s party of six or eight men , reached the home of Benjamin Cutbirth , some four miles above Old Field on the afternoon of the day that Cleveland arrived at Jesse Duncan s , and abused Cutbirth , who was a Whig and suffering from wounds he had but recently sustained in the American cause .\nRiddle , however , soon left Cutbirth s and went on to the upper end of Old Fields , where Joseph and Timothy Perkins resided , about one mile above Duncan s. Both these men were absent in Tory service at the time ; but Riddle learned from their women that Cleveland was at Duncan s with only his servant , Duncan and one or two of the Calloway family .\nRiddle , however , was afraid to attack Cleveland openly , and determined to lure him into an ambush the next morning .\nAccordingly , that night , he had Cleveland s horses secretly taken from Duncan s to a laurel thicket just above the Perkins house , where they were tried and left .\nBut , it so happened , that on that very Saturday , Richard Calloway and his brother-in-law , John Shirley , went down from the neighboring residence of Thomas Calloway , to see Col. Cleveland , where they remained over night .\nOn the following Sunday morning , discovering that his horses were missing , Cleveland and Duncan , each with a pistol , and Calloway and Shirley , unarmed , went in pursuit , following the tracks of the stolen horses , just as Riddle had planned .\nReaching the Perkins place , one of the Perkins women knowing of the ambuscade , secretly desired to save the Colonel from his impending fate , and detained him as long as she could , while his three companions went on , Cleveland following some little distance behind .\nShe also followed , retarding Cleveland by enquiries , until his companions had crossed the fence that adjoined the thicket , where they were fired upon by Riddle s men from their places of concealment .\nCalloway s thigh was broken by the shot of Zachariah Wells , but Duncan and Shirley escaped .\nCleveland dodged into the house with several Tories at his heels .\nThere he surrendered on condition that they would spare his life ; but when Wells arrived he swore that he would kill Cleveland then and there , and would have done so had not the latter seized Abigal Walters and kept her between him and his would-be assassin .\nRiddle , however , soon came upon the scene and ordered Wells to desist ; after which , the whole party with their prisoner and his servant were speedily mounted and hurried up New river , traveling mostly in its bed to avoid being tracked , in case of pursuit .\nTwo boys , of fourteen and fifteen , Daniel Cutbirth and a youth named Walters , had resolved to waylay Riddle on his return to Benjamin Cutbirth s , and rescue whatever prisoners he might have with him ; but they were deterred from their purpose by the size and noise of Riddle s party as they passed their place of concealment that Sunday morning .\nRiddle s party got dinner at Benjamin Cutbirth s where one of Cutbirth s daughters was abused and kicked by Riddle because of her reluctance in serving Riddle s party .\nAfter dinner Riddle s party proceeded up the bed of New river to the mouth of Elk creek , where the new and promising town of Todd now flourishes at the terminus of a new railroad now building from Konarok , Va. , Cleveland meanwhile breaking off overhanging twigs and dropping them in the stream as a guide to his friends who , he knew , would soon follow in pursuit .\nFrom the head of the south fork of Elk , they ascended up the mountains in what has since been known as Riddle s Knob , in what is now Watauga county , and some fourteen miles from the place of Cleveland s captivity , where they camped for the night .\nMeantime , early that Sabbath morning , Joseph Calloway and his brother-in-law , Berry Toney , had called at Duncan s , and hearing firing in the direction of Perkins s home , hastened there ; but , meeting Duncan and Shirley in rapid flight , they learned from them that Richard Calloway had been left behind for dead and that Cleveland was either dead or captured .\nDuncan , Shirley and Toney then went to notify the people of the scattered settlements to meet that afternoon at the Old Fields , while Joseph Calloway rode to Captain Robert Cleveland s place on Lewis Fork of the Yadkin river , a dozen miles distant .\nHis brother , William Calloway , started forthwith up New river and soon came across Benjamin Greer and Samuel Mc Queen , who readily joined them , and together they followed Riddle s trail till night overtook them ten miles above the Old Fields , where Calloway and Mc Queen remained , while Greer returned to pilot whatever men might have gathered to engage in the pursuit of the Tories .\nGreer soon met Robert Cleveland and twenty others at the Old Fields , and all started at once , reaching Calloway and Mc Queen before day Monday morning .\nJohn Baker joined Calloway and Mc Queen to lead the advance as spies or advance guards ; and , soon after sunrise , the nine men who were in advance of the others fired upon Riddle s party , while Cleveland tumbled behind the log on which he was slowly writing passes for his Tory captors .\nBut Wells alone was shot , being hit as he scampered away by William Calloway , and was left as it was supposed that he had been mortally wounded .\nRiddle and his wife mounted horses and escaped with the others of his band .\nCleveland s servant , who had been a pack-horse for the Tory plunderers , was rescued his master .\nCaptain Ross , Riddle s Virginia prisoner , was rescued .\nShortly after this Riddle captured on Kings creek at night two of Cleveland s noted soldiers , David and John Witherspoon , who resided with their parents on Kings creek , and spirited them many miles away in the mountain region on Watauga river .\nHere they escaped death by taking the oath of allegiance to the King of England , and were released ; but as soon as they reached their home , David hastened to notify Col. Ben .\nHerndon , several miles down the Yadkin , who with a party of men , under the guidance of the Witherspoon brothers returned and captured Riddle and two of his noted associates , Reeves and Gross , sic - Goss who were taken to Wilkesboro and executed on the hill adjoining the village on a stately oak .\nMrs. Riddle , who seems to have accompanied her husband on his wild and reckless marauds , was present and witnessed his execution .\nWells had been captured and hanged by Cleveland a short time before .\nP. 446 .\n54 xii .\nJoseph Callaway , born Bef .\n1755 in Ashe Co , NC ; died Bef .\n1830 in Callaway , MO. .\n55 xiii .\nFrances Generation No. .\n1 1 .\nSimon Baker was born Abt .\n1500 in Faversham , Kent Co , England .\nAll history beginning with George Baker , born 1775 in England Anna Swaine ; going back to Simon Baker , born 1500 in Faversham , Kent Co , England ; provided by Delbert L.

BUNCH Kd4vqd@juno.com My Aunt , Lillie Baker Allen , was born on Sacker Creek in Clay County , Kentucky in 1891 .\nShe died in Lexington , Kentucky in 1987 , at the age of 96 .\nHer father , George W. Baker was born in Owsley County in 1871 and died at burning Springs in Clay County in 1912 .\nThe family , shortly after his death , moved from there .\nLillie was just a young woman at the time ; the love for the mountains and its people remained with her until the day she died .\nThis lady and her remarkable memory started me out Baker hunting .\nOften when I talked to Aunt Lillie about her family , she would refer to them as Good Bakers , Bad Bakers .\nIt wasn t until after her death that I began to understand what she was trying to tell me .\nShe told me that her grandmother , Ibby Baker , was a Baker before she married .\nShe said the Ibby was a schoolteacher , and that she went to Buffalo Creek in Owsley County to teach .\nHere she met and married Jackson Baker .\nJackson died in 1878 , leaving Ibby and their small son George .\nAfter the death of her husband , Ibby returned to Clay County and lived with her brother .\nShe died a year later .\nHer son George W. Baker was adopted and raised by her brother , William Baker and wife Elizabeth Parker .\nAunt Lillie wrote me a letter one time about the Bakers on Buffalo Creek in Owsley County .\nThese were the one s she called Bad Bakers .\nShe said her father received word from his aunt , Martha Gabbard , to come up to Owsley County , that the family had sold some land , part of which belonged to his father .\nHis aunt went on to tell him that she was holding his part of the money from the sale for him .\nAunt Lillie said ; We didn t want him to go .\nWe thought it was a Catch !\nWe thought they were trying to get him up there to kill him .\nTo the relief of Aunt Lillie and the family , her father George made the trip to Bull Skin and returned home safely .\nI once asked Aunt Lillie where the Bakers came from ?\nShe said ; They came from Liverpool England , they were gunsmiths and that they came to this country to make guns for the colonies .\nAt the time Aunt Lillie told me this , I paid little attention .\nOf all the great things Aunt Lillie told me , this statement would prove the most important .\nShe died without me having the opportunity of telling her what I learned about this unique family .\nSo I would like at this time to share my story with you We begin our story with Abner Baker , first County Clerk of Clay County .\nAbner was born in Prince Edward County , Virginia , September 18 , 1775 .\nHe came to Kentucky in 1795 and first settled in Garrard County where he married Elizabeth Buford .\nHe was appointed Clerk of Garrard County in 1803 and held this office until he moved to Clay County in 1807 .\nAbner Baker kept a records keeping book throughout his life he called his Life Book .\nIn this small notebook he kept records about his family .\nYou can imagine my surprise when I read the following statement taken from this book .\nAbner Baker stated that there were three brothers Samuel , Andrew and Caleb , who first came to America .\nThey were gunsmiths with a grant from the King of England to manufacture guns for the colonies .\nHe goes on to say that his grandfather , Caleb Baker , and his family removed from Lancaster , Pennsylvania , bought land and settled in what was then called The Backwoods in Amelia County , Virginia on Buffalo Creek .\nWas this just a coincident , or were Aunt Lillie and Abner Baker talking about the same Baker family ?\nA Mr. Samuel E. Dyke , a researcher in Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , finally convinced me I was on the right tract when I came across some writings .\nThis was a report given to the Kentucky Rifle s Association in 1972 .\nIt seems that the Association had employed Mr. Dyke to do some research for them .\nThey wanted him to see if he could find out the person or persons responsible for making the first Pennsylvania Rifles or what was sometimes call the KENTUCKY LONG RIFLE .\nMr Dyke in his report states ; We feel as though these early gunsmiths came into Chester , Pennsylvania , or New Castle , Delaware , from abroad and migrated up the Susquehanna River to where the Pequea flows into it and set up shop making guns .\nHe goes on to say that Robert Baker came into Lancaster County Court on August 15 , 1719 and asked permission to erect a gun boring mill at the mouth of Pequea Creek on his land .\nPermission was granted .\nRobert Baker and his son Caleb set up their gun shop and operated it until 1728 .\nIt was at this time Robert Baker died .\nHis son , Caleb Baker , continued to operate this gun shop until the family moved to Amelia County , Virginia .\nThe above Caleb Baker was the grandfather of Abner Baker , first Clerk of Clay County .\nAlthough Abner Baker is the one of the most interesting of people , he is not the subject of our story .\nI only used his statements and those of Mr Dyke to establish the fact that some of the Bakers now living in Clay and Owsley Counties can trace their ancestor s back to these early Pennsylvania Bakers .\nAbner Baker , in his Life Book , stated that his grandfather Caleb , had two brothers , Andrew and Samuel Baker .\nThese two brothers would prove the most adventurous of this Baker Family .\nIn the early 1750s Andrew Baker , John Cox , Enoch Osborn and several other neighboring families in Pennsylvania set out on a westward journey .\nThis journey eventually led them into the Yadkin River Valley , in present day Wilkes County , North Carolina .\nThis small group of Pennsylvanians would be among the first to settle in the area .\nSome of these people settled along the Yadkin River , others of the more adventurous nature , crossed the Blue ridge Mountains and settled along New River in what is now Ash and Allegheny Counties , North Carolina .\nNo white man had attempted settlement here before .\nNew River was known at the time only by it s Indian name Saxphaw .\nIt was here , along the south branch , Andrew Baker made his first home .\nAndrew Baker remained in the area of New River until about 1753 , He then decided to push even deeper into Indian country .\nHe moved down New River into what is now Grayson County , Virginia , very near the North Carolina line .\nHere Andrew staked out a large track of land he called his Peach Tree Bottom track .\nBut the next summer , he and his family were run out by the Indians .\nHe returned to his prior settlement on New River , where he would remain for the next ten years or so .\nHe did , however , make one other attempt to settle his Peach Tree Bottom track .\nThis was in 1767 or 1768 .\nThis time he encountered another problem .\nIn Andrew s long absence , Dr. Thomas Walker , a surveyor for the Loyal Land Company , had staked and claimed the Peach Tree Bottom track , for his employers .\nHe had to now purchase a 1000 acres of his original claim before he could resettle on it again .\nIt seems that it just wasn t meant to be .\nThe following year , he was once again forced out by the Indians and back to his old settlement .\nOne might wonder why Andrew was so determined to settle this particular track of land .\nThe answer lay in what was on and in this land , more so , than the land itself .\nFor you see , one of the largest iron ore deposits in this area was discovered on the land .\nI think Andrew Baker , and at least one of his sons , were involved in the Iron business .\nHis son James Baker and he built several large iron furnaces along Cranberry Creek , a tributary of the south branch of New River .\nThe remains of some of these Iron Furnaces can be seen even today .\nThey were at their peek production during the Revolutionary War .\nThe Balance of this article THE GOOD BAKERS - THE BAD BAKERS by Clyde N. Bunch is found in notes on John Renta Baker in this site .\nEditors Note It is interesting that a Thomas Anderson , Sr , from Kentucky , was with General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans and stood next to another Kentucky sharpshooter , who shot General Puckingham from his white charger .\nThe general thought he well out of range but underestimated the accuracy and range of the Kentucky Long Rifle !\nAfter the battle , Thomas Anderson walked back to Kentucky only to find that his family had moved to Dubois County , Indiana .\nSo he just walked on over to Indiana .\nTwo of his sons , John and Thomas , Jr , married two of my GG aunts , daughters of David G.

Notes for MATOAKA POCAHONTAS POWHATAN In 1616 , John Rolfe and his wife , Pocahontas , in company with Sir Thomas Dale , also of the company , ventured to England to show off the Princess to the King and Queen .\nWhile in London she gave birth to their only child , a son , Thomas Rolfe .\nNot long after this Pocahontas died at Gravesend .\nJohn returned to his beloved Virginia with his young son and when Thomas was old enough to attend school John sent him to England for that purpose and he took lodgings , and was under the care and tutorship of his uncle , Henry Rolfe .\nThomas thereafter returned to his home in Virginia and settled on a large estate in old Henrico County now Chesterfield above where Petersburg now is .\nHe married Miss Jane Poythress and by her had one daughter , Jane Rolfe , before his untimely death .\nThe American Colonies of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries all had stringent laws prohibiting interracial marriages .\nBecause Pocahontas and John Rolfe were married very early in the seventeenth century with the approval of the then Governor of the colony , and because Pocahontas was of royal albeit aborigine blood , the statutes in Virginia made an exception in their case .\nThe laws of the other colonies , however , were very strict , and the punishment was severe .\nThus , Thomas Rolfe was safe but only in Virginia or back in England .\nHe chose to return to Virginia to claim the vast amount of land Powhatan had given the couple when John and Pocahontas married .\nWhen Jane Poythress died , after bearing an only daughter , Thomas Rolfe is reputed to have left Virginia and moved to North Carolina , where he is also reputed to have married again .\nWith the laws of North Carolina so strict , both then and during the next century or so , it is understandable that Thomas would never have mentioned the fact that he was half Indian , nor would that information have likely been passed down in the family tales .\nIf , in fact , Thomas did remarry after he left Virginia and sired a number of male children , it would be reasonable to assume that one or more of them returned to the motherland , particularly if they knew of their ancestor s ethnic background and were therefore nervous about remaining in the colonies .\nFor a full view and additional genealogy regarding Pocahontas visit the site listed below .\nClick here http \\/ \\/ www.angelfire.com\\/co2\\/family1\\/ Maggie From Maggie Cal To BBrown7152 Hi Byron I show Morris Baker as the son of Andrew and Mary Molly Baker . . here are the notes I have on Andrew and Mary . . listing their children Mary Mollie Bowling Bolling was my great great great great grandmother .\nMargaret Gourley \\/ Baker Severns .\n42 .\nMary Molly18 Bolling Robert17 , John16 , Robert15 , Edward14 , Tristram13 , Edward12 , Tristram11 , Robert10 , Robert9 , John8 , Robert7 Debolling , John6 , William5 , John4 , Robert3 , William2 , William1 was born 1702 in Virginia37 , and died WFT Est. .\n1764-179837 .\nShe married Andrew Baker WFT Est. .\n1714-174537 , son of Robert Baker .\nChildren of Mary Bolling and Andrew Baker are 56 i.

Byrd while still in his teens .\nEdward and his wife had a son named Benjamin , who was born in 1709 in Virginia .\nA year later , Edward died at sea at the mighty age of twenty-three .\nThere is strong evidence that Edward s widow left VA shortly after Edward s death and settled in NC .\nWe also believe that the Baker family had also settled there , because it was at this time that we first see unions between Bollings and Bakers , and this habit continued for more than one generation .\nAn example of this is the fact that Benjamin Bolling Edward s son had a son who married Martha Baker , and the names are connected by marriage even after some of the folks migrated to Kentucky .\nBecause of Molly s birth date , I am personally unable to identify who her parents might be .\nShe was too old to be a child of Edward Bolling and too young to be a child of Edward s son and therefore a sister to the renowned Benjamin 1734-1832 , about who we talk so much .\nTo help me out , I am turning to the fellow I have selected as the greatest authority on the Benjamin Bolling line .\nThat is Chet Bolling , a descendant of the two Benjamins and a student of the line for almost half a century .\nChet has been under the weather recently , but if he knows the answer as to who Molly s parents were , you can bet that we ll get a quick answer by e-mail .\nIn the meantime , I must admit that I can not pin down the parents of Molly Bolling Baker , although I am aware of the close relationship between the two families .\nWe ll just have to wait and see what Chet has to say .\nSee you in Richmond next August .\nBud Wm.\nKennon Sr. , was a great uncle to Mary Bolling Baker .\nThe Kennon s and the Bollings owned over 100 , 000 acres in the Amelia and Henrico Counties .\nLand Office Patents and Grants It is not known when Andrew Esq. , came to Virginia , with his brother Caleb , or perhaps with his brother Douglas , who bought 1,415 acres in Amelia Co. , on both sides of Spring Creek , off the Buffaloe River in 1739 .\nL.

S. as well .\nToday , Roy Thomas Baker spends most of his time in the U. S. While keeping Los Angeles his home base , he has built a beautiful studio complex of his own , complete with tennis court and olympic swim spa .\nHis elegant facility is a three-and-a-half hour drive from L. A. in the foothills of the Mojave mountains , above the shores of Lake Havasu .\nHis fabulously appointed and well-equipped studio contains hard-wired TLA , Summit and Neve mixers ; a rare Stephens 40-track fine-tuned and maintained by John Stephens with Dolby SR ; and six Tascam DA-88s .\nFans of his work will want to look for upcoming releases by Local H , Other Star People and Caroline s Spine .\nMuch of your production work draws from the best of American and British popular music idioms .\nWhat music helped form your tastes growing up , and what elements of that have carried over into your work ?\nThe thing that I loved was the way American blues went over to England and got bastardized with artists like Clapton and the Stones , and then went back to America .\nIt was this continual bouncing back and forth between the two places that all started off with Southern blues players .\nOne of my main inspirations was black music .\nIt didn t matter whether it was Tamla \\/ Motown or Stax or the early blues , which I loved .\nIn fact , I didn t know that the early blues existed until I heard the Stones and Clapton as a kid .\nI suddenly realized , These guys are great .\nWhere did they get it from ?\nThat s how I learned about it .\nI also loved American pop .\nI loved the stuff that was being done by Bob Crewe and Phil Spector .\nWhen I think of the Four Seasons , The Ronettes and the Beach Boys wafting away with their four - and five-part harmony vocals-those kinds of great vocals were not coming out of England at the time , except in opera .\nOne common element found on many of your records is huge , thick harmony vocal parts .\nNow I can see the connection with the Beach Boys and the Four Seasons .\nOh , yeah .\nYou can hear what was inspiring me as a producer , to inspire bands I was working on to do that , or connecting me with the bands that were good at doing that .\nWith The Cars , you had this band with a sparse rhythm section and a unique singer in Ric Ocasek , but when the harmonies kicked in , it was a wall of sound .\nThey came at a time when rock radio really needed some freshening up .\nI was going through my own little demons at the time .\nI had been doing Queen , which was kitchen sink over-production , which I loved .\nBut in the same way that we had the alterna-music thing in the early 90s , the end of the 70s had the punk era .\nI would run into the Sex Pistols , because they were working over at Wessex .\nThey were saying the usual , All you bands are going to be gone because you re over-produced and you re all fags , and all that .\nLaughs It was really funny .\nI thought , Maybe there is a point where I should be a bit more sparse .\nSo when I did the first Cars record , we purposely did it very sparse , but when the harmony vocals come in , there are as many vocals there as there were in a Queen record .\nThe only difference is it was in and then it was gone .\nGood Times Roll is a classic one for that .\nWhen they sing those words , it s huge and then it s gone , and everything is back to sparse again .\nI was able to put big vocals on a sparse , punkish background , sort of inventing post-punk pop .\nWith Other Star People , which I recently finished , we re inventing post alterna-pop .\nLaughs I remember when the first Cars record hit Number One on the charts , I was driving on Sunset Boulevard with Ric Ocasek .\nWe drove past a billboard for the Cars record , and he said , If someone had told me a year ago that I would be driving along Sunset Boulevard with Roy Thomas Baker looking up at a billboard of my record that is Number One , I wouldn t have believed him .\nOn T Pau s Heart and Soul , your approach to the rap portions of the song was unique .\nWe did Heart and Soul , and there was this rap vocal for the first verse ; total rap .\nInstead of just going out to a mic and just talking , I did 12 tracks of talking vocal for one speaker , 12 tracks for the other speaker , 12 for the middle , and then 12 tracks that were put out of phase to wrap around you , and that was just for the rap section , before any singing started .\nIt was scary and was hard work , and it took a couple of days to do it .\nI remember Carol Decker the singer walking out of the studio , bursting into tears , and saying to my wife , Tere , I hate your f -- ing husband , but when the record hit the charts everywhere , it was all fun .\nLaughs So even when I did a straight rap record , it wouldn t be someone merely rapping into a mic ; it would have to be something totally unusual and different .\nWith Queen , the whole idea of big vocals were taken to outrageous , operatic levels .\nBohemian Rhapsody was totally insane , but we enjoyed every minute of it .\nIt was basically a joke , but a successful joke .\nLaughs .\nWe had to record it in three separate units .\nWe did the whole beginning bit , then the whole middle bit and then the whole end .\nIt was complete madness .\nThe middle part started off being just a couple of seconds , but Freddie kept coming in with more Galileos and we kept on adding to the opera section , and it just got bigger and bigger .\nWe never stopped laughing .\nThat was at a time when rock bands were so intent on being heavy .\nThis was not exactly a cool idea .\nIt was very left of center .\nExactly .\nIt started off as a ballad , but the end was heavy .\nFor the technical people , who may want to know , the end of the song was much heavier because it was one of the first mixes to be done with automation .\nWhat happened was we had VCAs built into a Trident board over at Sarm Studios in London .\nThey put it in with the old Allison computer .\nIf you really listen to it , the ballad starts off clean , and as the opera section gets louder and louder , the vocals get more and more distorted .\nYou can still hear this on the CD .\nThey are clearly distorted .\nWhen we got to the end section , the part in Wayne s World where they start doing this he bobs his head up and down , there was no headroom on the VCAs , yet there was loads of headroom on the Trident mixer .\nSo we got them to disconnect the computer and literally take all of the VCAs out of the faders and give us a direct feed for the faders to the mixer .\nAnd we mixed the whole of the end section by hand .\nThe way we used to mix Queen was very odd , and it evolved over time .\nWe had a big Trident board in the control room , and every one of the guys would have to look after their own little parts .\nThey were turning on tom-toms and riding bass runs and Brian May was turning on and off all of his guitar parts .\nThen we would take all of the outputs from the Trident down to a separate mixer , and I would control all of the drum fills and bass fills and do all of the stuff that I m good at .\nSo they would be looking after their little bits , and I would actually be using their fingers as automation .\nThen I basically had the main mix in front of me .\nIt wasn t done on computers .\nIt was done live .\nThe main feed from my mixer was going to the 2-track .\nSo that was the way we would mix a record .\nKiller Queen was done that way .\nAll the phasing parts weren t done in the mix ; they were done live .\nFor example , the part about the laser beam was printed to tape with the effects during recording .\nIf you listen to the multitrack , all the effects are on the tape .\nThe only thing different is the end of Killer Queen is actually real tape phasing .\nThat was a post-production decision .\nSo do you typically print effects to tape when you record ?\nI m not one of these , Oh , we ll cut this and leave the effect for the mix .\nI actually record the effects .\nThere is the artistic reason People play differently when they hear the effect and are playing to it .\nSecondly , it makes it so much easier to mix , because the effects are already there .\nYou ve got to make these decisions up front .\nExcept for just basic echo , I tend to also use the effects as we go , when we record vocals .\nFor the really effected vocals on the new Local H record , we did the effects live with the performance .\nWe had already visualized what we needed , so we did that as we went along .\nWhen Scott , the singer , sang with the effect in his headphones , he could work with it and make the effect work a million times better .\nI always visualize the overall sound of the album at the beginning .\nYou voice the parts and arrange the instrumentation that you use right at the very beginning .\nWith Local H , we knew the running order of the album before we even started recording , so we could work out our segues .\nWe had the plans on how one song would go into another and make the whole album a non-stopping entity .\nWe even recorded everything in the running order , so we could actually edit together the tracks from the 40-track Stephens , so they were flowing together before we even did any overdubs .\nI never just leave it up to the mix and just hope .\nOne characteristic found on many of your records is the artful segue .\nI love segues , because I like records to be continuous and it gives me a good excuse not to turn off the music and put on something else .\nSometimes the record company initially didn t like them , not for artistic reasons , but because they thought that disc jockeys would have a problem taking the record off at that point .\nSo an alternative copy for radio with these big five-second spacings between each song would be made , as in the case of Journey s Infinity .\nWhat made it funnier was disc jockeys played the segues even more on that album .\nThey played the first three or four songs of The Cars first album together , too .\nLaughs Even now , they are still playing the segues .\nYour records have always sounded like they were practically exploding out of the radio .\nWhat things did you do to help ensure that effect ?\nAs long as you know up front that a certain song is destined for radio and MTV , you should come at it straight out of the gate from the beginning in pre-production .\nWe make sure that the sound is together from day one .\nThe whole idea is to make you sound louder , so that it jumps out in your face .\nThe trick to this has to do with creating apparent volume , as opposed to actual volume .\nSee , the radio station s compressors will react to actual volume and turn the music down .\nThat s why some people s mixes will actually sound quieter than the song previous and the song being played after .\nWhen we first record , we re always saturating .\nWe have all the machines lined up in such a way that we have everything hitting the end stops .\nI run everything in the red all of the time .\nI don t look at meters .\nWe run the consoles in the red , especially the tube ones like the Summit and TLA tube mixers and the Neve .\nWe run the machines in the red , right down to the tape .\nWe check back to the tape to make sure that we re not over-saturating .\nFrom what I understand , you ve startled more than a few proper engineers with your methodology .\nOh yeah !\nAll the time .\nI just whack those faders up .\nThat s what I do .\nEspecially when I m mixing the drum rides - I would whack them up so loud that they would saturate the mixing board and then they would saturate the tape machine .\nObviously , after a certain level , they don t get any louder on tape .\nIt gets louder when you re watching it , but it doesn t get any louder on tape , because it has reached its peak .\nWhat happens is the bottom end fills out .\nIt is technically distortion , but it is also bringing out those nice third and fifth harmonics that you want to hear .\nDoing it this way adds a tremendous value to the bass end .\nIt makes it grind and pump out on the radio more .\nIt s apparent volume , as opposed to actual volume .\nMany artists seem to feel that they should produce themselves .\nWhat are your thoughts on that ?\nEvery artist would like to produce their own records .\nThat to me is a bit like someone wanting to be their own lawyer in court , and even if you are a lawyer , you shouldn t represent yourself in court .\nI think , even if you re a great producer who happens to be an artist , and you re great at working with other artists , you should never produce yourself .\nYou still need somebody else around to make sure you get the best out of yourself , because you can t be in two places at once .\nA lot of artists will go to an engineer , who is probably a great engineer , but as of that stage has not seriously produced anything .\nThey forget that there s more to a production than getting a nice , polished sound .\nPeople will not go out and buy a nice drum sound if the song isn t there .\nWhen Ric Ocasek does his own records , he doesn t always produce himself .\nHe lets other people produce him .\nYet , Ric is a very good producer and has produced some hits himself , like Weezer .\nWas there a pivotal moment where a light went off and you thought , I want to be a producer ?\nNo , I think I always wanted to be a producer from the age of 11 or 12 .\nMy opportunity came with my internship at Decca .\nWe called it apprenticeship over there ; you call it internship in America .\nIt s basically where you do all the dull work for 24 hours for no pay .\nLaughs And nothing has changed .\nNor should it change .\nIt s a great way to sort out the people who are really genuine and the people who are in it for a quick buck .\nYou can t make a quick buck in that route .\nYou have to work very hard and eventually , if you are given that opportunity , and you succeed at that opportunity , then there are big bucks to be made .\nIt is hard work up to that point .\nI think I was paid the equivalent of 12 pounds a week ; no overtime , nothing .\nI subsidized my pay by being a race car mechanic , which I actually thought was great fun anyway .\nIt gave me Saturdays making sure there were great fuel injectors on these race cars .\nWhat would you say is a primary guiding philosophy behind your production work ?\nMy whole thing is , the more different you can sound from anything else around but still be commercially successful is great !\nOver the years , I ve always hearkened back to that philosophy .\nBack when I did Bohemian Rhapsody , who would ve ever thought of having a single with an opera section in the middle ?\nThe first Cars record was totally unique .\nEven projects I did when I was going from second engineer to engineer , like T - Rex s Get It On Bang A Gong or Free s All Right Now , had a different twist on what was basically the same thing .\nPeople need an identifiable sound .\nWhen your song is being played on the radio , people should hear who that is , even without the DJ mentioning who it is .\nThat s true with all the great bands , even ones that have been around for hundreds of years , like the Stones .\nEven though they have had a lot of different changes of sound , you can hear who it is instantly .\nThat rule applies for every great band of the last 30 years .\nThere are thousands and thousands of bands out there with these really smooth , great , generic-sounding records that nobody gives a toss about .\nThen somebody like Beck comes along and he hits a can and sings about being a loser and he gets a Number One , and who knows what that was recorded on ?\nLaughs And who cares ?\nI loved it !\nIf you don t have that identifiable sound , you are getting merged in .\nIf the DJ isn t mentioning who it is , then nobody will know who it is .\nIt will just be another band , and nothing is worse than being anonymous .\nThat is exactly what you don t want .\nWant to use this article

'Search | Back Issues | Author Index | Title Index | Contents D - Lib Magazine October 2000 Volume 6 Number 10 ISSN 1082-9873 A Grammar of Dublin Core Thomas Baker GMD -- German National Research Center for Information Technology Scientific Library and Publication Services Schloss Birlinghoven D-53754 Sankt Augustin , Germany thomas.baker@gmd.de We begin with the sentence , because the sentence is the unit of discourse , because words can be classified only from their function in the sentence , and because the pupil should , from the outset , see that what determines the words in the sentence and the sentence itself is the thought .\nAlonso Reed and Brainerd Kellogg , Higher Lessons in English , 1877 Dublin Core Made Simple Dublin Core as a Language .\nDublin Core is often presented as a modern form of catalog card -- a set of elements and now qualifiers that describe resources in a complete package .\nSometimes it is proposed as an exchange format for sharing records among multiple collections .\nThe founding principle that every element is optional and repeatable reinforces the notion that a Dublin Core description is to be taken as a whole .\nThis paper , in contrast , is based on a much different premise Dublin Core is a language .\nMore precisely , it is a small language for making a particular class of statements about resources .\nLike natural languages , it has a vocabulary of word-like terms , the two classes of which -- elements and qualifiers -- function within statements like nouns and adjectives 1 ; and it has a syntax for arranging elements and qualifiers into statements according to a simple pattern 2 .\nA Pidgin for Digital Tourists .\nWhenever tourists order a meal or ask directions in an unfamiliar language , considerate native speakers will spontaneously limit themselves to basic words and simple sentence patterns along the lines of I am so-and-so or This is such-and-such .\nLinguists call this pidginization .\nIn such situations , a small phrase book or translated menu can be most helpful .\nBy analogy , today s Web has been called an Internet Commons where users and information providers from a wide range of scientific , commercial , and social domains present their information in a variety of incompatible data models and description languages .\nIn this context , Dublin Core presents itself as a metadata pidgin for digital tourists who must find their way in this linguistically diverse landscape .\nIts vocabulary is small enough to learn quickly , and its basic pattern is easily grasped .\nIt is well-suited to serve as an auxiliary language for digital libraries .\nThis Grammar .\nThis grammar starts by defining terms .\nIt then follows a 200-year-old tradition of English grammar teaching by focusing on the structure of single statements see the Reed and Kellogg quote above .\nIt concludes by looking at the growing dictionary of Dublin Core vocabulary terms -- its registry , and at how statements can be used to build the metadata equivalent of paragraphs and compositions -- the application profile .\nElements and Qualifiers Vocabulary terms in general .\nStrictly speaking , a Dublin Core element or qualifier is a unique identifier formed by a name e.g. , title prefixed by the URI of the namespace in which it is defined , as in http \\/ \\/ dublincore.org\\/2000\\/03\\/13-dces#title .\nIn this context , a namespace is a vocabulary that has been formally published , usually on the Web ; it describes elements and qualifiers with natural-language labels , definitions , and other relevant documentation .\nCurrently there are two namespaces for Dublin Core the Dublin Core element set and the Dublin Core Qualifiers , denoted here by the conventional abbreviations dc and dcq DCMI 1999 , DCMI 2000 .\nIn this paper , as in many application environments , the elements and qualifiers are referred to in a machine-readable short form , such as dc title .\nElements .\nThe fifteen elements of the Dublin Core element set are the defining feature of Dublin Core as a language .\nIn their short form , the elements are dc title , dc creator , dc subject , dc description , dc publisher , dc contributor , dc date , dc type , dc format , dc identifier , dc source , dc language , dc relation , dc coverage , and dc rights .\nThese correspond to fifteen broadly defined properties of resources that are generally useful for searching across repositories in multiple domains .\nQualifiers .\nQualifiers modify the properties of Dublin Core statements by specifying , in the manner of natural-language adjectives , what kind of subject , date , or relation .\nQualifiers currently fall into two classes .\nEncoding schemes are pointers to contextual information or parsing rules that aid in the interpretation of an element value .\nFor example , dcq lcsh qualifies dc subject to specify that the keywords are a Library of Congress Subject Heading , and dcq iso8601 qualifies dc date to specify that the string 2000-06-13 is formatted according to an international standard .\nElement refinements make a property more specific without extending its meaning , such as dcq revised as a modifier of dc date yielding date revised .\nIn July 2000 , a DCMI Usage Committee recommended a batch of fifty-two qualifiers to exemplify these principles of qualification , but the qualifiers for Dublin Core statements may also come from other namespaces , as in the example yans author below where yans is a hypothetical Yet Another Name Space .\nElements and qualifiers defined in languages other than English .\nStrictly speaking , elements and qualifiers are represented by machine-readable tokens that stand for general concepts such as title , subject , and date .\nThe Dublin Core Metadata Initiative discusses and approves their definitions in English .\nIn principle , however , they can be labeled and defined equally well in any other language , such as Dutch or Arabic or Thai .\nFor example , dc creator may be labeled Creatore in Italian , Pencipta in Bahasa Indonesian , or Verfasser in German Baker 1998 .\nTo date , the element set has been translated into twenty-six languages .\nBear in mind as you read that although this grammar is written in English , a Japanese version could translate every English word here into Japanese -- all grammar terms and example sentences included -- except for the English-like names of the tokens themselves .\nDublin Core Statements Diagramming statements .\nSince the 1870s , the grammar of sentences has been taught in American high schools using sentence diagrams Reed and Kellogg 1886 , House and Harman 1950 , Warriner et al. .\n1973 .\nThis style has a binary flavor -- the sentence baseline is intersected to divide the subject , that of which something is said , from the predicate , that which is said of the subject .\nWithin the predicate , a smaller line separates the object in Dublin Core terms , the property from the objective complement in Dublin Core , the property value .\nThis style is nicely expressive of Dublin Core because the qualifiers , hanging below the baseline on slanted lines , are visibly subordinate to the properties they modify see Figures 1 and 2 .\nFigure 1 The general pattern Parts of a Statement .\nDublin Core is in effect a class of statements of the pattern Resource has property X , where resource is the implied subject ; followed by an implied verb has ; followed by one of fifteen properties from the Dublin Core element set ; followed by a property value -- an appropriate literal such as a person s name , a date , some words , or a URL .\nFor example Resource has dc creator Tom Baker , and Resource has dc date 2000-06-13 .\nOptional qualifiers may make the meaning of a property more definite , as in Resource has dc date dcq revised 2000-06-13 .\nPrinciples of Qualification .\nThe qualification of Dublin Core properties is guided by a rule known colloquially as the Dumb - Down Principle .\nAccording to this rule , a client should be able to ignore any qualifier and use the description as if it were unqualified .\nWhile this may result in some loss of specificity , the remaining element value minus the qualifier must continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery DCMI 2000 .\nQualification is therefore supposed only to refine , not extend the semantic scope of a property .\nIn borderline cases , qualification should not result in a literal that could be misleading .\nAppropriate Literals .\nWhether a property value is useful for discovery is at the heart of the notion of appropriateness .\nA property value should be a string of an expected type -- usually , for example , some sort of name for dc creator , dc contributor , dc publisher , or dc title ; a URL for dc relation , dc identifier , or dc source ; full-text sentences for dc description ; short text strings or keywords for dc subject , dc type , dc format , and dc language ; and a recognizable combination of years , months , and days for dc date .\nBoth in theory and in practice , the range of expected data types varies from property to property ; which types are appropriate for a given property is open to interpretation and debate see below .\nEvaluating Statements .\nTo test whether a Dublin Core statement is conceptually solid , cover the qualifiers with your hand dumbing down , read the statement above the line , and ask Does it make sense ?\nIs it factually and logically correct ?\nIs the literal appropriate for the given property ?\nExamples Figure 2 Some statements , diagrammed Resource has dc title A Grammar of Dublin Core .\nDoes it make sense ?\nYes .\nIs it correct ?\nYes .\nIs the literal appropriate ?\nYes , a sequence of words is normal and expected for the property dc title .\nResource has dcq iso8601 dcq revised dc date 2000-06-13 .\nThis means that a resource was revised on 6 June 2000 .\nThe statement dumbs down to Resource has dc date 2000-06-13 , which means that the date 6 June 2000 has something to do with the life-cycle of the resource .\nThis is less specific than the qualified statement , but still correct .\nResource has dcq lcsh dc subject Languages -- Grammar .\nThis says that the resource is about the subject grammar of languages , and that these words are a controlled term from the Library of Congress Subject Headings .\nThe statement dumbs down to Resource has dc subject Languages -- Grammar , which makes sense even if we do not know that the term comes from the Library of Congress .\nResource has yans cerif dc subject H352 Grammar , semantics , semiotics , syntax .\nThis literal includes a language-independent abbreviation , H352 , which will be useful for applications that understand yans cerif .\nThe string H352 may confuse some users , but otherwise does no harm .\nResource has yans author dc creator Tom Baker .\nUsers of the yans namespace will recognize that yans author is being used here as an adjective modifying dc creator just as talk is an adjective modifying show in the phrase talk show .\nIt is an awkward but correct way to say that Tom Baker is the author sort of creator -- i.e. , the author -- of the resource .\nThis statement dumbs down to Resource has dc creator Tom Baker , -- less specific but still correct .\nResource has dc relation http \\/ \\/ www.dlib.org\\/dlib\\/december98\\/12baker.html .\nThe statement asserts that the resource is somehow related to an article in D - Lib Magazine a URL is appropriate as a literal for dc relation .\nSome not-so-good examples Resource has dc creator name . given Thomas ; name . family Baker ; employer GMD ; contact Schloss Birlinghoven , D-53754 Sankt Augustin .\nA reader can see what this compound or structured value is saying .\nBut a search engine would need to know how to parse out the components and suppress the tags in order to index this cleanly , lest a search for creators named Augustin should yield false hits .\nGenerally speaking , things like affiliations and addresses -- properties of the creator of a resource -- do not belong in Dublin Core statements about the resource itself .\nMetadata providers that used such compound values within specific usage communities could speak Dublin Core to the rest of the world by exporting just the name Resource has dc creator Thomas Baker .\nResource has yans creator Tom Baker .\nThis statement is useful for applications that recognize the yans namespace , but it is not a Dublin Core statement per se .\nIf the yans and dc definitions of Creator were compatible , either the metadata provider or an indexing application could use a crosswalk to translate this into the Dublin Core statement Resource has dc creator Tom Baker .\nOngoing Issues Fifteen fuzzy buckets .\nThe properties of Dublin Core are like fifteen big buckets , and the rules about which types of literals may be placed in those buckets are somewhat fuzzy .\nThis fuzziness is intentional -- the Internet is a diverse and chaotic place where a more disciplined , top-down approach to standardization is unrealistic , especially for use across multiple domains and languages .\nIf the rules of Dublin Core were more precise , people would inevitably bend them .\nIn the jargon of computer science , then , Dublin Core is weakly typed as a language .\nA search engine may find a variety of information types in any given bucket -- from URLs to non-textual , alphanumeric strings to full text in any language .\nThe appropriateness of literals .\nRequirements for the appropriateness of a literal are in practice somewhat contradictory .\nIdeally , a literal should be useful for discovery , which means it should make sense as is to the average user .\nYet it should also be processable in an expected way by search engines .\nProgrammers need to be know , for example , when to index on strings separated by white space , minus punctuation and stop words , when to expect a URL , and when to expect an alphanumeric date string .\nSome elements are particularly ambiguous in this regard .\nDc rights , for example , can be free text or a URL .\nDc coverage can be a place name , the name of a time period , a numeric identifier for a place or time , or even a compound value -- in effect , a miniature schema with multiple sub-components separated by semicolons or XML tags .\nWhere such a range of data types is permissible , should it be acceptable to relax the Dumb - Down Principle ?\nShould qualifiers in effect modify the expected data type of the literal ?\nOr should the presence of , say , XML angle brackets be expected to trigger , automatically , a change in parsing algorithms ?\nWould such a complexification of a property compensate for the corresponding loss of Dublin Core s overall simplicity ?\nOr can the need for complex description be resolved in a broader framework , outside Dublin Core per se ?\nApplication profiles .\nOne broader framework for such a resolution is the application profile .\nAs currently defined , application profiles are the metadata equivalent of regional idioms or creoles complexified pidgins .\nImplementors who need an application language more expressive than a pidgin may combine elements and qualifiers from Dublin Core with elements from other namespaces into a richer vocabulary or embed them into a syntactically more sophisticated data model .\nSuch linguistic innovation is considered by many people to be reasonable as long as implementors respect a distinction between namespaces , where elements and qualifiers are given standard definitions , and profiles , where elements from multiple namespaces are only reused , combined , adapted , and constrained Heery 2000 .\nThe profile , then , is the natural locus for full descriptions -- the catalog card or metadata package taken as a whole .\nFor example , the Collection Description Schema of the Research Support Libraries Programme RSLP in the UK uses dc title -- officially defined as a name given to the resource -- but defines it more narrowly as a name given to the collection .\nAlongside such Dublin Core elements , it uses elements from other namespaces , such as cld access Conditions for the hours of access and classes of permitted users from a local Collection Level Description namespace .\nThese elements are framed in a data model that specifies typical relationships between a collection , its individual items , a collector , an owner , a location , and the constituent parts of a collection -- each of which may be described with multiple attributes RSLP .\nAn RSLP description does not talk just about information resources per se , but also about the people , organizations , and access frameworks related to those resources .\nDeveloping profiles and coining new elements .\nSome working groups of DCMI are developing domain-specific profiles of Dublin Core , surveying the descriptive needs of domains such as education and government to determine an appropriate mix of Dublin Core elements and elements from other namespaces and perhaps to coin additional elements for concepts not covered in existing standards .\nThese working groups need to consider that literals appropriate to domain specialists may not make much sense to general users , especially in statements that have been dumbed down .\nAs the example above makes clear , moreover , core elements are needed for classes of resources other than document-like objects , such as people and organizations generically , agents and spatially and temporally grounded events .\nUrgently required are data-model conventions for combining multiple entities within an application profile -- for example , to include an author s affiliation and address in the description for a resource -- and stable formats for the encoding of profiles as XML or RDF schemas .\nBuilding a dictionary registry for Dublin Core .\nHistorically , the standardization of national languages such as English has been helped by the compilation of dictionaries .\nGood dictionaries often strike a balance between prescribing guidelines for good style and describing a living language with examples of actual usage .\nMetadata languages like Dublin Core have hitherto been developed prescriptively , in standards committees , as there have been no convenient ways to track local innovations in usage and feed them back into the standardization process .\nHowever , several related developments are now enabling the collective construction of metadata dictionaries , or registries .\nThe new Resource Description Framework RDF Schemas standard of the World Wide Web Consortium provides a format for publishing schemas that can be harvested by metadata search engines W3 C 2000 .\nEric Miller has developed an open-source software toolkit for indexing a distributed corpus of RDF schemas as one huge database , with an interface for following hyperlinked cross-references between related terms in namespaces and profiles -- in effect , a metadata schema browser EOR .\nThe Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is using this toolkit to manage its namespace Open Metadata Registry , and a working group is formulating technical and policy guidelines for its ongoing management DC - Registry .\nA European project , SCHEMAS , is promoting the use of RDF schemas to help harmonize metadata practice among EU-funded projects and is using RDF to build a layer of annotated pointers to namespaces , profiles , and metadata activities generally SCHEMAS .\nDoes your application speak Dublin Core ?\nPidgins are inherently limited in what they can express , but they are easy to learn and enormously useful .\nIn real life , we talk one way to our professional colleagues and another way to visitors from other cultures .\nOur digital library applications need to do this as well .\nSimplicity and complexity are both appropriate , depending on context .\nIf Dublin Core is too simple or generic to use as the native idiom of a particular application , pidgin statements may be extracted or translated from richer idioms that exist for specialized domains .\nThis output should also be filtered to keep the fifteen buckets clear of encoding debris and semantic silt .\nOne should treat digital tourists with courtesy and hide from them the complexities of a local application vocabulary or grammar .\nHowever sophisticated its local idiom may be , an application might also speak a pidgin that general users and generic search engines will understand .\nSimple , semantically clean , computationally obvious values will help us negotiate our way through a splendidly diverse and heterogeneous Internet .\nAppendix Dublin Core and RDF grammar compared Directed Labelled Graphs .\nThe Resource Description Framework RDF , a relatively new standard of the World Wide Web Consortium , is emerging as an information model and encoding format of choice for metadata and application profiles that use Dublin Core W3 C 1999 , W3 C 2000 .\nRDF is a grammar for expressing relationships among resources located or represented somewhere on the Internet .\nThese relationships are depicted graphically with Directed Labelled Graphs DLGs , which use arcs predicates expressing properties to establish a relationship between multiple nodes resources .\nNodes are seen as subjects or objects depending on the direction of the arrow .\nFigure 3 The general pattern of RDF statements triples RDF triples .\nIn contrast to the binary flavor of the pedagogical English grammars cited above , the model of RDF statements is a tripartite one of subject , predicate , and object see Figure 3 .\nRDF statements , accordingly , are called triples A property is a specific aspect , characteristic , attribute , or relation used to describe a resource .\n... A specific resource together with the named property plus the value of that property for that resource is an RDF statement .\nThese three individual parts of a statement are called , respectively , the subject , the predicate , and the object .\nThe object of a statement i.e. , the property value can be another resource or it can be a literal ; i.e. , a resource specified by a URI or a simple string or other primitive datatype defined by XML .\nIn RDF terms , a literal may have content that is XML markup but is not further evaluated by the RDF processor W3 C 1999 .\nFigure 4 shows an RDF triple consisting of the subject http \\/ \\/ www.w3.org \\/ Home \\/ Lassila , predicate has creator , and object Ora Lassila .\nFigure 4 Directed Labelled Graph of a triple Subject of an RDF statement .\nThe subject of an RDF statement is anything that can be named by a Universal Resource Identifier URI .\nIn principle , this is anything from a Web page or museum artifact to an abstract concept or event .\nThe subject of a Dublin Core statement , in contrast , is an anonymous information resource , perhaps a document-like object 3 .\nIn Dublin Core , the subject resource is always implied , never named as in RDF .\nThe RDF statement in Figure 4 , then , would be expressed in Dublin Core as two statements Resource has dc identifier http \\/ \\/ www.w3.org \\/ Home \\/ Lassila , and Resource has dc creator Ora Lassila .\nAs long as it is clear from the context that the two statements refer to the same resource -- for instance , they are both in the same record -- one can infer that Ora Lassila has created the Web page 4 .\nEnglish Dublin Core RDF words have classes tokens have classes nodes and arcs nouns elements adjectives qualifiers sentences have parts statements have parts statements have parts subject implied subject subject predicate predicate verb implied verb implied verb object property property objective complement property value object property value modifiers qualifiers Figure 5 Grammar Terms Compared Predicate of an RDF statement .\nThe predicate of an RDF statement is an implied verb plus a property .\nThis is more restricted than the standard definition of a predicate in high-school English grammar , which includes in effect everything to the right of the vertical intersector in a sentence diagram -- that is , everything within a clause that is said about a subject .\nHowever , since most people have only the vaguest recollection of predicates from high school , this grammar avoids using the term at all .\nProperty value of RDF statements .\nIn RDF , these are called objects .\nBut again , there is risk of confusion with English grammar .\nIn the sentence This paper has the title A Grammar of Dublin Core , some high-school English grammars see A Grammar of Dublin Core as an objective complement with respect to the object of the sentence , title see Figure 5 .\nCompounding the confusion , computer scientists are oriented to objects of a much different sort , and the resource of a Dublin Core statement might even be a physical object .\nThis grammar avoids the term object altogether .\nThe lack of qualifiers in RDF .\nIn Dublin Core , qualifiers depend on and modify one of Dublin Core s fifteen elements properties .\nThe basic RDF model does not express this type of dependency .\nProperties may relate to another as narrower to broader terms using the relation Sub Property Of , as Author relates to Creator .\nIn native RDF , however , both Author and Creator are full properties in their own right .\nThe compatibility of Dublin Core and RDF .\nThe differences between Dublin Core and RDF outlined above are largely terminological ; at issue is what the parts of a statement such as Resource has Property X should be called .\nThe difficulty of choosing the right words for this grammar should not obscure the basic compatibility and complementarity of Dublin Core and RDF .\nRDF offers a general model for statements , while Dublin Core offers a particular type of pidgin-like statement about information resources and privileges a small set of special words .\nRDF offers a specific encoding in XML for expressing its conceptual model , while Dublin Core is by design independent of any particular encoding format .\nRDF , then , is just one of the possible information models that can use tokens from Dublin Core , while Dublin Core is just one of the languages expressible in RDF .\nFootnotes 1 It would be desirable to have a word for Dublin Core vocabulary terms in general -- elements and qualifiers as a whole -- just as natural-language nouns , verbs , adjectives , and conjunctions are all called words .\nUnfortunately , entities , concepts , and symbols are all too abstract and vague ; words are associated too closely with natural language ; and lexemes are too obscure .\nThe first draft of this paper spoke generically of elements and distinguished between core elements and qualifiers , but veterans of Dublin Core found this confusing .\nThe next draft introduced tokens , which conveys the notion that Dublin Core vocabulary terms stand for general concepts that are defined and labeled in many natural languages , but people also found this confusing .\nVocabulary terms seems a bit cumbersome , so I avoid the term whenever possible and speak simply of elements and qualifiers .\n2 Early in the workshop series , before it was formally called a Metadata Initiative , the Dublin Core effort was declared to be primarily about semantics in contrast to syntax , and the latter was declared to be out of scope .\nIn that context , however , syntax referred to the encoding of metadata in HTML , database , and later XML or RDF formats ; it involved questions such as which tags to place where , within what angle brackets or punctuation , and how to group or nest related elements .\nThis grammar , in contrast , presents the syntax of Dublin Core statements in a linguistic sense , as the rules governing how the words of a sentence are related to each other -- which words modify other words , and which words are of central importance in the statement .\n3 In practice , the reasoning behind this is circular Dublin Core properties are appropriate for any entity that has such properties .\nThis circularity has spared us a perhaps futile attempt to seek philosophical consensus on a universal ontology of entity classes and allowed us to get on with the task of describing whatever it is we are describing .\n4 Dan Brickley points out that software tools could exploit additional information about entities and vocabularies to translate sequences of RDF-encoded Dublin Core statements into a natural-language style that flows more elegantly and reads less like a pidgin .\nAcknowledgements I have discussed this paper with many colleagues from both DCMI and other communities .\nSpecial thanks to Bill Arms , Jose Borbinha , Dan Brickley , David Bearman , Rachel Heery , Linda Hill , Diane Hillmann , Erik Jul , Carl Lagoze , Sigfrid Lundberg , Eric Miller , Paul Miller , Andy Powell , Shigeo Sugimoto , and Stuart Weibel for valuable comments on the drafts .\nMany thanks to Michael Kasper for advice regarding the literature on English grammar .\nReferences Baker 1998 Thomas Baker , Languages for Dublin Core , D - Lib Magazine , December 1998 , -LRB- http \\/ \\/ www.dlib.org\\/dlib\\/december98\\/12baker.html&gt;

Following the success of the Cars , Baker now split his time between hard rock bands like Journey he produced the group s Infinity and Evolution albums and new wave groups like Devo .\nIn later years he produced Ozzy Osbourne s No Rest for the Wicked , but was relatively inactive during the 90s .\n~ Steve Kurutz , All Music Guide Worked With Geoff Workman , Mark Volman , Ian Taylor , Howard Kaylan , John Deacon , Elliot Easton , Roger Taylor , Brian May , Freddie Mercury Wikipedia Library -RRB- Reference -RRB- Wikipedia Roy Thomas Baker Roy Thomas Baker is an English record producer who helped create a number of extremely popular pop and rock records in the 1970s and 1980s .\nPerhaps best known for co-producing the enduring hit song Bohemian Rhapsody for Queen , he also worked with numerous , notable artists , including Guns N Roses , The Who , The Rolling Stones , David Bowie , The Cars , Foreigner , Journey , Ozzy Osbourne , T.

'Advanced Search Thomas Baker Mc Questen Tom , Tim , Tomity , Tomty Jun. .\n30 , 1882 - Jan. 13 , 1948 You do not know what a help and strength you have been to your mother .\nI am so nervous and anxious minded that if you had been anything else but what you are I would certainly have broken down .\nIf you had been a lazy good for nothing , selfish and unsympathetic , it seems to me I would have died , for people do die of broken hearts .\nW - MCP2-4 .037 a Thomas Baker Mc Questen was just six years old when his father died in 1888 .\nHe was physically and mentally robust , intelligent , athletic , handsome and genial .\nHe embodied the best hope for the family s return to financial stability ; therefore , Mary concentrated all of the family resources on him .\nMary s letters to him demonstrate her great affection for him and her dedication to his success .\nShe molded his attitudes , morals , and provided his life s plan .\nShe was not as concerned about his health and abilities as she was about Calvin s. Tom is always mentioned with pride and affection by all family members .\nTom was educated at Hamilton Public Schools and graduated from Hamilton Collegiate with honors in English , History and Classics .\nHe entered the University of Toronto in 1900 and distinguished himself by winning the Alexander Mackenzie Scholarship for Political Science in 1903 which brought a very small cash prize .\nHe was president of his fraternity Zeta Psi and editor of Varsity .\nTom very nearly won the Rhodes Scholarship in 1904 , the first year it was offered , but it became a political contest , and he lost out to another candidate .\nThe scholarship would have provided $ 1500 per year and it was a sad blow and disappointment to his mother when he did not win .\nThe money would have made a great deal of difference to the family and it was a long time before his mother was able to forget it W5199 , W5271 .\nTom s sister , Ruby , a teacher , continued to send money to Tom to pay for his tuition , and his father s former law partner , James Chisholm , helped him as well .\nHe had a variety of summer jobs which often involved physical labor and he grew lean and tough .\nThis included work on a cattle boat by which he made his way to England and Scotland to visit the original family home there in 1901 .\nHe also worked in the lumber camps on the Ottawa River for the summers of 1903 and 1904 , but the danger in this work was kept a secret from his mother W8164 .\nIt was a long hard struggle , and in April of 1907 , when Tom was twenty-five years of age , he was still requiring money from his family for fees and living expenses W5812 .\nAfter graduation from Osgoode in 1907 , Tom practiced law at Elk Lake near Cobalt during the silver mining boom .\nHe loved the hardy life in the North where he could hike and canoe , but the opportunities for success were bleak .\nThomas s family made many sacrifices for his education and he was twenty-seven years of age , in 1909 , before he had a stable income with James Chisholm , a member of Tom s father s law firm in Hamilton .\nTom s initial salary was $ 1000 per year , with some prospects of sharing profits as well , and his mother soon urged him to press for this increase , as well as for a finer-looking office W8239 .\nShe also stated that it is certainly going to mean a great difference to us ; however , it was also in 1909 that Ruby s health expenses began to mount , and Edna required medical treatment for mental illness from time to time .\nBy 1911 , Tom was able to give some conditional assurance to his mother and to Calvin that there will be no lack of money but we just have to arrange it W6732 .\nTherefore , it was twenty-one years , from 1888 to 1909 , before Mary and her family were able to feel some relief from the financial pressures .\nTom became the titular head of the family , but Mary continued in control ; she convinced him to stay in Hamilton , and urged him into politics and public works .\nTom never married , but there is some evidence that he was engaged to a Miss Elliott in Toronto .\nHis mother did not hear about it except by rumor , and Tom finally introduced his mother to Miss Elliott after his graduation from law school in 1907 .\nAlthough Mary did not approve , she had to deal more carefully with her son , and the relationship continued secretly for some time .\nMiss Elliott attempted to win Mary s approval by commissioning a miniature of Mary to be painted by an artist friend ; however , Mary continued to find fault with it , and made it an issue between Tom and Miss Elliott .\nMary was not one to be seduced so easily and Miss Elliott was no match for her W5868 , W6012 .\nPrecisely why Mary objected to Miss Elliott is never explained in the letters , but it likely has its source in the fact that Thomas had been groomed by his mother to replace his father as the successful lawyer and family provider , which would restore the family to its former status .\nNow when Tom had just graduated and was on the brink of becoming their savior , he was considering abandoning them .\nTom certainly felt his obligation to his mother and sisters to take financial responsibility for their support , which he did after he went into law practice , but he would not have earned enough money for many years to support a wife as well .\nMary had already established , in her objection to David Ross s marriage to Ruby , that it was a disgrace for a man to consider marriage until his duty to his own family had been fulfilled .\nThe family , especially Ruby , had made many sacrifices to pay for Tom s education , and he was only now , at the age of twenty-six , beginning to show some promise of providing some financial relief for the family .\nAlthough there is no direct evidence that Mary actively broke up the relationship , it did not come to fruition and Tom continued to fulfill his duties to his family .\nHowever , Thomas was handsome and popular and had other relationships with women , but they were very discreet and he never married Best 205n1 .\nBoth Tom and Calvin preferred to spend their time away from home .\nAlthough Tom was reluctant to come back home to live , he finally determined that the best place for him was Hamilton where he could practice law and enter politics .\nHe stated to Calvin It would be almost hopeless for a Liberal to get elected in Toronto .\nI think I would stand a far better chance in Hamilton , but then , I could not afford to be a stranger there W8176 .\nAt the same time the matriarchal pressure was mounting to get him involved in law and politics at home and Mary stated that she hoped that here I may get him interested in some other good works as well as , indeed , she did W6318 .\nThomas s career is recounted fully and admirably in John Best s biography Thomas Baker Mc Questen Public Works , Politics and Imagination 1991 , and in Roland Barnsley s biography Thomas B. Mc Questen 1987 .\nI direct the reader to these works for a full account of Thomas s political career and accomplishments .\nHowever , I will note a few important events here especially as they relate to his mother s influence .\nTom was elected vice-president of the Hamilton Liberal Club in 1912 , where John Chisholm was president .\nTom was then elected to Alderman for the City of Hamilton in1913 which he held until 1920 .\nHis family encouraged him and campaigned vigorously in his political career .\nIn the war of 1914-18 Tom favored conscription and was determined to join the armed forces .\nHe had already served in the Militia during university .\nHis mother was adamant that he not go and , after much argument , he did not enlist .\nIn 1914 Tom was already thirty-two years of age and was the sole support of his family .\nMary did not support the war and felt the money and the lives could have been used to better advantage in the missionary field .\nShe could not risk losing Tom and deplored the loss of the lives of young Canadians and their mothers left to mourn them W6828 .\nShe also viewed the war as a male folly and was quite disgusted with the way men do things W6975 .\nTom proceeded , with his mother s urging and full approval , to fulfill himself in public works .\nHe was an astute politician and a good judge of character and quickly learned how to manage people , but he preferred to work behind the scenes , taking little credit for himself .\nHe formed partnerships with other lawyers , politicians , engineers , architects , artists and horticulturalists to effect his plans to beautify the city and the province .\nIn this he was reflecting the family s dedication to social reform through city planning , beautification and education .\nThis late Victorian cultural impulse was known as the Social Gospel and City Beautiful movements .\nSignificantly for this study , which was originally done as a Ph. .\nD. thesis under the auspices of Mc Master University , Thomas Mc Questen was instrumental in bringing Mc Master University to Hamilton from Toronto .\nOther cities in Ontario were competing for the university throughout the 1920 s , but the factor that tipped the scales in Hamilton s favor was the offer by the Hamilton Board of Parks Management , of which Tom was a member , to provide the attractive Westdale site and magnificent landscaped grounds Barnsley 29 .\nThe site was turned over to Mc Master in 1928 .\nThe Sunken Garden and Lily Pool was a quiet haven of inspiration for scholars , and attracted many visitors until the garden was destroyed for the construction of the Mc Master Medical Center .\nTom viewed Mc Master as one of the finest contributions that he and his team were able to accomplish Best 58 ; 7010 .\nWe ve never landed such a fish as this .\n.\n.\n.\nOur whole development has been along mechanics lines .\nAnd the result has been , the owners don t live here .\n.\n.\n.\nand Hamilton has become too much a factory town .\nThis is the first break toward a broader culture and higher educational development .\nIt was sorely needed .\nDid I ever think what a great word university is ?\n- It has never been let down , never become stale or commonplace , always dignified and lofty Best 58 .\nMary s letters in 1928 and 1930 Reveal her pride in Mc Master s growth , both as a university and as a park , Very large contributions coming in for Mc Master ; nearly the $ 500,000 , and again C. Whidden was amazed at the flowers , can not take any more students .\nIn these pursuits Tom had his mother s encouragement and , after Tom learned to drive in 1928 , he took her on many trips to inspect various parks , greenhouses , and Mc Master University and its gardens W7010 , W7080 , W7085 , W7095 , W7124 , W7128 , W7136 .\nTom served on the Hamilton Board of Parks Management from 1922 to 1948 .\nWithin the first decade , by 1932 , Hamilton had the largest acreage of developed park land and playgrounds in any Canadian city .\nThis included Gage Park , Cootes Paradise , Scott Park , King s Forest Park , Chedoke Golf Course , The Royal Botanical Gardens Rock Gardens and The High Level Bridge posthumously renamed the Mc Questen High Level Bridge .\nTom fulfilled his familial and his public duties admirably .\nHis friend and associate on the Parks Board , C. V. Langs , summed up Tom s self-sacrificing dedication T. B. Mc Questen is a bachelor .\n.\n.\nwhose bride is the city parks system Best 68 .\nTom s sister Hilda acted as his hostess for social and political functions , and they were an attractive and charming couple at various functions .\nThere is no doubt that Hilda s charm , grace and intelligence added to Tom s success , and that Mary was extremely proud of them .\nThey often received invitations to social functions .\nTom fell under the influence of Noulan Couchon who was an advocate of The Garden City Movement which was sweeping England and Europe and which viewed parks as the lungs of the city The Spectator , Hamilton , Dec 7 , 1991 .\nAs well as the influence of his mother and sisters , there was a strong feminine content in Tom s work .\nHe hired Laurie Dunnington as part of the married team of Dunnington - Grubbe , who were garden designers , and he employed Frances Loring and Florence Wyle as the sculptors for his projects .\nAfter his mother s death in1934 , Tom continued to expand his and his mother s public conservation and beautification vision .\nIn the same year he was elected to the Provincial Government and was appointed to the Cabinet with two portfolios Minister of Public Works and Minister of Highways for Ontario .\nIn this position he was responsible for the construction of the Queen Elizabeth Highway and other roads , the Rainbow Bridge , the Blue Water Bridge at Sarnia , and the Ivy Lea Bridge at Gananoque .\nHe had a strong sense of history and his ministry reconstructed Fort Henry , Fort Erie and Fort George and the Martello towers at Kingston .\nTom was also chairman of the Niagara Parks Commission and oversaw the construction of the Niagara Parkway , the Floral Clock , the Oakes Garden Theatre , Queen Victoria Park , Queenston Heights Park and Restaurant , as well as the School for Apprentice Gardeners which provided training and graduates for the maintenance of the parks .\nTom dedicated himself to his family rather than to marriage and children , and he devoted his life to public works in education , beautification , and community improvement .\nTom was also self-effacing and gracious in giving credit to his mother for her encouragement and imagination , and he referred to her as his best chum Barnsley 18 .\nMary s obituary in the Hamilton Herald Dec 7 , 1934 states Tom s acknowledged indebtedness to his mother as the inspiration for his achievements Mr. Mc Questen has told of the large part his mother has played in molding his tastes , his standards and his plan of life .\nNot the least of her contributions to him was to give him a love for beauty that was large enough to spread out and influence the appearance of a great city ... Large areas of Hamilton are , in the last analysis , a reflection of her love for beauty .\nTom was awarded the Hamilton Citizen of the Year Award which Calvin accepted on his behalf while Tom was ill in hospital with cancer .\nHe died on January 13 , 1948 , and is buried in the family plot in Hamilton Cemetery .\nUnlike many politicians , Tom did not profit from his political career beyond his salary ; he was scrupulously honest , and when he died he left a modest estate of $ 50,000 including his share of Whitehern Best 191 .\nHowever , he and his mother and family left to the world the many beauty spots which are a testament to their lives .\nRegrettably , only one of these perpetuates the Mc Questen name .\nThomas Baker Mc Questen was also honored by the Hamilton Public Library in 1986 when he was inducted into their Gallery of Distinction .\nPOLITICAL POSITIONS AND APPOINTMENTS Minnes , p. 1-5 City Alderman for Ward 2 , Hamilton 1913-1920 Chairman of special gas committee , fought for municipal ownership of Hamilton gas distribution systems Liberal Association President of Hamilton Liberal Association 1921-1923 Management Committee of the Liberal Party in Ottawa 1925 Vice - President of the Ontario Liberal Association 1930 or 1931 President of the Ontario Liberal Association 1932 or 1933-43 Member of Provincial Parliament , Ontario 1934-1943 Commissioner on Hydro - Electric Power Commission 1934-1937 Minister of Municipal Affairs 1940-1943 Minister of Public Works 1934-1937 , 1942-1943 Minister of Highways 1934-1943 Chairman of Works Committee , Hamilton Board of Parks Management 1922-1947 Chairman of Niagara Parks Commission 1934-1943 Chairman of Niagara Bridge Commission 1939-1947 Home | Search | Thesis | Family | Timelines Photographs | Whitehern | Sitemap | Credits Copyright 2002 Whitehern Historic House and Garden The development of this website was directed by Mary Anderson , Ph. .\nD. and Janelle Baldwin , M.

'How Bakersfield Got Its Name By Chris Brewer Colonel Thomas Baker , senator , assemblyman , Colonel of the Iowa Territorial Militia , Receiver for the United States Land Office , developer , lawyer , surveyor , statesman , and entrepreneur .\nThese are some of the titles which Baker could lay claim to during his lifetime .\nHe was responsible for the settlement of many communities in both Iowa and California .\nOne such community bears his name , Bakersfield , California .\nBaker was described as being a man of rather slender build , about five feet ten or eleven inches in height , and having a light complexion .\nHe is said to have been a fair scholar , and to have had good business qualities .\nHe was born and raised in Ohio , growing up there , later moving to the Territory of Wisconsin , which soon became Iowa Territory .\nFirst relocating , to Slaughter County , in 1838 , Baker was appointed as Clerk of the Court of the first District Court .\nLater that year , he was also appointed as the Clerk of the Board of County Commissioners .\nA self-taught attorney , he was also appointed as the first United States District Attorney for Washington County , holding that office until Iowa was admitted to the Union as a state in 1846 .\nIn 1841 , Baker was nominated as a Colonel in the Iowa Territory Militia .\nBaker served on the Fourth and Sixth Territorial Legislative Assemblies .\nContinuing to be involved in State government , Baker relocated to Polk County , and later , Des Moines .\nOnce Iowa gained statehood , Baker was elected as a member of the first State Legislature as a repre-sentative of a large district made up of Marion , Polk , Jasper and Dallas counties .\nDuring his tenure in the Iowa legislature , Baker drafted many laws in the state s first code .\nHe was elected President of the State Senate , thus becoming ex-officio , Iowa s first Lieutenant Governor .\nPolitical turmoil was the determining factor to send Baker packing for California in 1850 , arriving in the fall , landing first , according to family lore , in Benecia .\nBaker soon moved inland to Stockton , a port on the San Joaquin River .\nBy 1852 , he proceeded southward to the delta land in the northern area of the newly formed Tulare County .\nThis area was rich in its forests of Oaks , Sycamores and other indigenous trees .\nBaker and his family were among the first four families to settle in the area which was later to become the city of Visalia in Tulare County .\nOld timers and family alike credit Baker with laying out the town for Nathaniel Vice , the credited founder of the town .\nBaker s second wife died in the mid 1850 s , and he , not being much of a bachelor remarried at age 47 .\nHis new bride , Ellen Whalen , was a young woman of twenty .\nIn 1855 , Baker was elected to the State Assembly , representing Fresno and Tulare counties , serving in 1856 and 57 .\nBaker was also appointed Receiver for the United States Land Office by President James Buchanan , serving during Buchanan s term .\nIn 1861 , Baker was elected to represent Tulare and Fresno Counties in the State Senate , serving in the sessions of 1861-62 .\nBaker and his son , James , were taken to the Kern Island area in 1857 by Captain Elisha Stephens , who led the first wagon trains over the Sierra Nevada .\nIn 1856 , Baker was involved in a legislative act which created an opportunity to reclaim swamp and overflow lands in the southern valley .\nThis act , eventually known as the Montgomery Act , offered the right to reclaim all the swamp and overflow lands belonging to the state , located between the San Joaquin River at Kings River Slough and Tulare Lake .\nFor this , the contractors would be deeded a percentage of the recovered land .\nThis act would later become the basis of Baker s activities in the southern San Joaquin Valley .\nThough not the original contractor , Baker and a partner purchased the rights to the contract and Baker moved onto Kern Island , purchasing Christian Bohna s property in 1862 .\nThough normally a swampy area , in 1864 , the southern San Joaquin Valley was suffering from the worst drought since the state was settled by Americans .\nBaker was able to construct a dam across the outlet of Buena Vista Lake to control the flow of water .\nBy the summer of 1865 , due to the lack of rain , and the construction of several irrigation ditches which had diverted much water from Kern , Buena Vista and Tulare Lakes , the area dried up .\nAfter inspection of the drainage by the state , Baker was issued a patent for 87,120 acres of land in Kern , Tulare , and Fresno counties .\nThis was his part of the reclaimed land under the agreement .\nFrom a portion of the land he gained in Kern County , which happened to surrounded his homestead , Baker laid out a community which eventually became the City of Bakersfield .\nNow that the Bakers were settled in their new Kern Island home , other people became attracted to the area , and settlers started to trickle in .\nA Stage line ran between Los Angeles and Sacramento .\nAlong its route , freight loads of provisions began making their way regularly to Kern Island .\nColonel Baker s island became a regular stopping-off place for all travelers journeying through the San Joaquin Valley .\nWith the help of Indians , he cleared a place for a home garden , in which he raised corn , beans and potatoes .\nHis son , Thomas A Baker , often mentioned the fact that some of the cornstalks grew to be 22 feet high , and an ear of corn shelled an even quart .\nBy 1868 the valley was suffering from the second year of drought .\nUntil that occurrence , wild grass grew in abundance between the town and the nearby hills .\nIt was so plentiful that the residents took it up in bundles , hauling it off to their ranches , where they used it as feed for the livestock .\nEach year , Colonel Baker stashed away 50 tons of this grass , which he used as hay not only for his own stock but for his guests animals as well .\nBaker s Field was right on the main road between San Francisco and Los Angeles .\nTravelers en route were able to take advantage of the Colonel s hospitality , by stopping over and setting their stock out to pasture in what they naturally enough dubbed Colonel Baker s Field .\nIt was truly the only spot along the entire route , save for Visalia where they could find food for themselves and their animals .\nAs was seen in Tom Baker s comments , Baker and his family kept an open house policy , in genuine Southern style and , it was not long before they had gained a well-deserved reputation for feeding and lodging travelers and their stock , whether they came in the daytime or at night .\nThe Colonel and Mrs. Baker warmly welcomed each and every traveler .\nHe would not only give them meals and a room for the night , but he also fed the animals .\nHe never asked or accepted money for any of these services and courtesies , but considered himself well repaid by the pleasure his open-handed hospitality furnished him .\nIn November , 1872 , an epidemic of typhoid fever ravaged those living in and around Baker s Field , and among the first stricken was the 62 year old Colonel Baker .\nSo great was the grief of the stunned community he had founded , that until after the funeral the following Tuesday all business and social activity was halted .\nDuring his life , Baker felt compelled to make life better for the ordinary citizen .\nHe was a staunch states rights advocate , enough to be arrested for treason after his comments on the issue during the beginning of the War Between the States .\nBaker had a deep seated need to bring change to the ordinary way of life on the frontier .\nBecause of this , he was able to turn a malarial swamp into the bustling community of Bakersfield , California .\nAbout the Author Chris Brewer is the great , great grandson of Colonel Thomas Baker .\nHis grandmother was Diamond Baker .\nMr.\nBrewer was raised in Bakersfield and now resides in Exeter , Ca .\nwhere he is a commercial orange grower and historian .\nThe above article is excerpted from Mr.\nBrewer s upcoming biography on Colonel Baker and the Baker Family due out in 1998 .\nTo contact Chris Brewer send email to vintage@lightspeed.net Copyright 1997 , The Bakersfield Californian Email the

Benjamin Cleveland and Gen. Griffith Rutherford .\nAfter the war Thomas Baker married Mary Molly Cantrell in Wilkes County .\nHer maiden name and the date of marriage was given in her widow s pension application .\nIn her first deposition 7 Dec 1851 she listed 20 Mar 1786 .\nIn another deposition 31 Aug 1854 she listed 20 Mar 1787 , and finally in 1856 she listed 22 Sep 1787 .\nI assume the last is most accurate .\nShe mentioned she had no record of the marriage , nor was there a marriage bond for they married by publication banns .\nThey were married in Wilkes by William Nall , Justice of the Peace .\nMary or Molly was born ca 1767\\/68 per her age of 82 on the 1850 census .\nIn her deposition of 7 Dec 1851 she was listed as 83 years old , which agrees with the 1850 census entry .\nShe stated she had no record of her age , and that her husband was much older than she .\nActually he was only about 4 or 5 years older !\nThomas Baker was not listed on the 1787 State Census of North Carolina in Wilkes County .\nSeveral other Bakers were listed in that county though which see .\nThe Bakers lived with Thomas uncle Martin Gambill for a few years right after they married per Pension files .\nHowever they don t actually seem to be with them on the 1787 census .\nMartin Gambill was listed on that census in Wilkes in Capt.\nNall s company William Nall who was listed next door to him , and whose daughter Gambill had married .\nGambill s household contained one male aged 21 to 60 born between ca 1727 and ca 1766 .\nThat would be Gambill himself .\nHe also had two boys under 21 born ca 1766-1787 , one of which could be Thomas Baker , but it doesn t quite fit .\nThere was only one female in the house which was most likely Mrs. Gambill Nancy Nall .\nMorris Baker was just two houses away .\nThat suggests , but doesn t prove a relationship between the two Baker families .\nThomas Baker is listed on the 1790 census in Wilkes County .\nHe was in the 10th Company .\nThere was one other Baker there , though not listed nearby , Ab .\nBaker Abraham or Abram Baker .\nThomas uncle and foster-father Martin Gambill was also in that district .\n1790 census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census 1790 Wilkes Co , NC pg 123 Thomas Baker 1-1-1-0-0 Analysis 1 Male s 16 and Up before 1774 Thomas BAKER 1764\\/65 1 Male s under 16 1774\\/1790 Son ?\n1784\\/90 1 Female s any age before 1790 Mary Cantrell Baker 1767\\/68 wife I did not find Thomas Baker mentioned in Wilkes County , N.

then they compelled her to marry a Frenchman , named La Beau , June 14 , 1707 . the recode of her marriage is on file in Montreal .\nAs the education of women went , she was well-educated .\nShe and her husband lived together about 7 years and then he died , leaving her with two or three children .\nThe first that she saw of Thomas Baker was in 1707 , the year she married the Frenchman .\nBaker had been brought to Montreal a prisoner from Deerfield , Massachusetts .\nHe was a frisky young fellow and tried to escape ; the guard caught him and he was about to be shot , a Frenchman intervened and paid a suitable ransom to save his life and permit him to return to his home in Massachusetts .\nSomehow during the affair - which of course , made a great commotion among the inhabitants , both French and English - Christine Otis Le Beau made the acquaintance of the young man and gave him her sympathy and probably expressed her admiration for his courage in attempting to escape .\nIt may have been her husband who paid the sum for Baker , a ransom .\nAnyway , they became close friends then and did not forget it in the seven years that followed .\nThomas Baker returned home and , in time , became a Captain , and won fame in the public service .\nChristine remained in Canada and in the course of seven years became the mother of three children and a handsome widow of twenty-five years .\nThen it came to pass that Thomas and Christine met again and under circumstances entirely difference from those under which they had parted in 1701 .\nMassachusetts sent a commission to Canada in 1714 to arrange for ransoming the English prisoners there ; Major John Stoddard being at the head of it and Captain Thomas Baker a member - being famous now from his leadership of the Indian campaign in the White Mountain region , in which he secured the scalp of the famous Indian Sachem , Wattanummom , and by the deed perpetuated his name forever in Baker River which joins the Pemegewasstt north of Plymouth , New Hampshire .\nIt was near the junction of these rivers that the battle with the Indians took place .\nMoreover , besides , having the river named for him , the General Court of Massachusetts gave Baker a reward of 20 , summa cum laude .\nCaptain Baker , with the rest of the Commissioners , was in Montreal in March 1714 ; they met the prisoners and the officials and commenced negotiations .\nIt does not come within the scope of my paper to speak further of the negotiations than to say that Christine Otis Le Beau then and there met Captain Thomas Baker .\nShe was a handsome widow of twenty-five yeas in the bloom of health , sparkling with wit and womanly attractions ; he was a bachelor a few years older - tall , stalwart , and handsome in his military bearing .\nAfter they met and exchanged the usual formalities of such and occasion , she resolved in her own mind to return to New England ; he resolved in his mind to rescue that handsome widow from the thralls of popery and the hated and detested Frenchmen .\nThus matters stood for awhile ; negotiations made slow progress .\nThe French would not consent for her to go ; if she went , she must leave her children and lose all of her property .\nShe attempted to smuggle her personal property into a boat to carry them to Quebec - the French priests discovered her work and took everything from the boat .\nAbout this time in the negotiation , Capt.\nBaker was ordered by Major Stoddard to return to Boston and report progress and ask for further instructions .\nHe attended to these duties and returned .\nThe French continued as obstinate as ever in their refusal to let the captives go .\nThe Caption and the widow held a council of war ; she decided to leave her children and all her property , except her wearing apparel and what she could carry in her hands .\nThey secretly embarked on a boat and started on the voyage to Quebec , where Major Stoddard and other Commissioners were then stationed , Just imagine that trip of 160 miles in an ordinary boat !\nTalk about romance !\nWhy romance pales before the true story of the heroism of this woman who so loved Old Dover which she had seen only as a babe , and so loved the gallant captain , that she forsook all and trusted her life and her fortune to his care , It is easy enough to look back over 175 years , but what a struggle it must have been for her to look ahead sixty years .\nMajor Stoddard chronicles their arrival at Quebec in the summer of 1714 ; later they sailed with others for Boston , where they arrived 21 September of that year .\nFrom Boston she accompanied the Captain to Deerfield , and good Parson Stoddard took her in hand and soon made a good protestant of her .\nHe rebaptized her with her baby name Margaret , and took her into the church .\nThe townspeople became interested in her welfare and enthusiastic in the praise of her noble qualities .\nDecember 14 , 1714 , the town granted her a valuable lot of land on the condition that she marry Capt.\nThomas Baker .\nShe accepted the land and the conditions .\nThey were married in 1715 and set up housekeeping and farming in Deerfield ; they remained there two years , leading a peaceful , quiet and happy life .\nTheir first child was born June 5 , 1716 ; in due time Parson Stoddard christened it Christine , having previously baptized the mother by her baby name of Margaret .\nIn 1717 they removed from Deerfield to Brookfield where they resided on their farm until 1732 .\nIn 1718 she made a trip to Canada with the object in view of getting her French children and bringing them to New England .\nHer efforts were unsuccessful .\nThe Romish priests would not permit her to see them , much less bring them away ; on the other hand , they tried to persuade her to stay there .\nShe would not listen to them and so returned grieved in heart , but determined in spirit .\nThe women are few who could have endured what she did and not yield to the wily talk of the priests .\nIn 1719 Capt.\nBaker was elected Representative at the General Court of Massachusetts by the freemen of Brookfield , being the first to serve that town .\nHe served his town in that and various capacities , honorably and ably during the next ten years .\nIt was in this town that most of their children were born ; one of whom became one of Dover s most distinguished men , Col. Otis Baker .\nIn 1727 , Christine received a letter from the prelate who had been her priest in Canada , in which he urged her to return there and reunited with the Romish Church , presenting many theological reasons why he thought she ought to do so .\nInstead of returning to Canada , she turned the letter over to Gov.\nBurnet and he wrote an elaborate answer to the theological statements of the priest ; both the letter and the Governor s answer are in print in the Massachusetts archives of that period .\nThe Governor had the best of the argument , as you all can see by reading the letter and the answer .\nThe Kanuc priest never ventured a reply , nor made further endeavors to get her back to Canada .\nIn 1732 they sold their Brookfield property , which was a comfortable estate to a speculator , who in some way cheated them out of the whole amount of the sale , and left Capt.\nBaker and his family in very straightened circumstances .\nThey lived awhile at Mendon , and next at Newport , Rhode Island .\nOn account of the high standing of Captain Baker and his wife , the general court of Massachusetts very generously aided them to help them recover their fortunes .\nThe Court was furthermore inclined to do this as Captain Baker s health had given out so that he could not do any hard work that required manual exertion .\nThe Court granted Christine 500 acres of valuable land in York County , Maine .\nShe sold this land for a handsome sum of money with which she built a house in Dover to which they removed in 1734 .\nThis house stood at the corner of Silver Street and Central Avenue , where now is the brick block .\nAfter she had built and furnished it , she petitioned the general court of New Hampshire for a license to keep a public house , which petition can be found in the unpublished Provincial Papers of New Hampshire .\nHere she kept a public house for many years , and prospered in her business affairs , although her husband was an invalid all the rest of his years , until his death in 1753 while on a visit to friends in Roxbury , Massachusetts .\nThe record says he died of the lethargy , which I supposed the doctors in the twentieth century would call apoplexy .\nChristine died February 23 , 1773 , aged 85 years , and her remains were interred in the Col. Baker burial lot on Pine Hill .\nI know not whether the spot can now be found ; be that as it may , a marker of some kind ought to be placed near the spot - if not on her grave , so that future generations may know and honor the spot .\nHer record in Dover is of the best .\nHer house was a model of neatness , comfort and good cooking .\nWhen the Royal Governors passed through Dover they honored themselves by calling at her tavern ; they always left with a feeling of good cheer and the highest respect for their hostess .\nMay 11 , 1735 she united with the First Church , Parson Cushing being pastor .\nShe remained a devout member of this organization to the end of her life ; during her last few years she was an invalid , but all her wants were kindly administered to by her son Col. Otis Baker and his family , Rev.\nDr. Belknap , who was then pastor gave her that spiritual consolation which her four score years must have made her greatly enjoy ; and when she closed her eyelids forever at four score and five , he performed the last sad rites over her remains .\nHer son , Col. Otis Baker , lived in a house that he built several years before the Revolution where the Whidden house now stands at the corner of Silver and Atkinson streets .\nOf course , then Atkinson Street did not exist and Silver Street was simply the Barrington Road .\nIt was in this house that Christine Baker passed her old age ; Dr. Belknap was her next door neighbor , living where now is the Belknap School House .\nSeveral members of this Society are relatives of her ; all of the Baker family in Dover are her descendants .\nHer career as a whole is undoubtedly the most remarkable of any Dover woman previous to the Revolution .\nDover People in the past have been inclined to make too little account of heir heroes and heroines , while they looked up to those in Massachusetts because great writers and lecturers and Boston newspapers have for a hundred years continually talked about them and their great deeds .\nEven the heroine Mrs. Baker is rarely spoken of by Massachusetts writers as a Dover woman , though forty years of her life were passed here ; and here her distinguished son and grandson lived , and their worthy descendants .\nHer husband , Capt.\nThomas Baker , seems not to have taken an active part in public affairs after he came to Dover .\nHe was broken in health before coming here , and appears to have been an invalid during the nearly twenty years he lived here , coming in 1734 and dying in 1753 .\nHe assisted his wife in running the tavern , but from the first it was her tavern , not his .\nHis record during his vigorous years is that of an active and honorable man and he was held in high esteem by the authorities in Massachusetts , as was also his wife .\nThere ought to be a marker placed on the brick block at the corner of Silver Street and Central Avenue , designating that as the spot where Christine Otis Baker kept a tavern .\nThe reason she had to petition the General Court to grant her a license to keep a public house is supposed to be that the Selectmen of the town refused to grant it because they favored the proprietors of the old Dover Hotel .\nYou see , the officials of Dover one hundred and seventy years ago were not so much superior to those of the modern city ; they were afraid Mrs. Baker would hurt the business of old resident .\nBut the General Court gave her the required license and she kept a first class old-fashioned tavern .\nThis historical essay is provided free to all readers as an educational service .\nIt may not be reproduced on any website , list , bulletin board , or in print without the permission of the Dover Public Library .\nLinks to the Dover Public Library homepage or a specific article s URL are permissible .\nChristine Otis Baker\n',065

'By John Chintala Although Dean Martin fans might not instantly recognize the name Baker Knight , they certainly know the songs he s written .\nSuch Dino hits as Somewhere There s A Someone and Not Enough Indians as well as the classic ballads That Old Time Feelin and If You Ever Get Around To Loving Me all came from the pen of Baker Knight .\nHe was born Thomas Baker Knight , Jr. in Birmingham , Alabama on the Fourth of July in 1933 .\nAfter graduating high school , Baker served 3 years in the Air Force where he learned to play the guitar .\nFollowing his stint in the service , Baker attended the University of Alabama as well as an art school in Birmingham , and became a technical illustrator and draftsman .\nBut when Elvis Presley took the music industry by storm in 1956 , Baker dusted off his guitar , formed a rock band with several musician friends , and Baker Knight and the Knightmares was born .\nTheir most popular single , Bring My Cadillac Back , was written by Baker and sold a reported 40,000 copies in two weeks .\nHowever , executives felt it was a free commercial for Caddys so it was taken off the air .\nSubsequent releases didn t fare any better , and Baker soon found himself back to square one .\nAfter relocating to Los Angeles for a movie role that never materialized , Baker admits he had less than a dollar to his name when destiny arrived in the form of a teenage idol .\nA mutual friend introduced Baker to Ricky Nelson and the rest , as they say , is part of music history .\nBaker played a few of his songs for Nelson , including the melancholy ballad Lonesome Town .\nLess than six months later , in November 1958 , it reached Billboard s Top Ten as did its flip side , I got A Feeling , another Knight tune .\nIn recent years , Lonesome Town was featured in a memorable television commercial for a soft drink , heard in several major motion pictures , and recorded by Paul Mc Cartney on his 1999 album Run Devil Run .\nRicky Nelson would go on to record 20 more Baker Knight originals including the top ten hits Never Be Anyone Else But You and Sweeter Than You .\nOn January 11 , 1966 , Dean Martin cut his classic rendition of Baker s Somewhere There s A Someone , the first of eleven Knight compositions than Dino would record over the next six years .\nIn 1970 , Baker s original rock and roll inspiration , Elvis Presley , released Knight s The Wonder Of You , which reached the summit of the easy listening chart and also went top ten on Billboard s Hot 100 .\nDuring the Bicentennial Year , Dave and Sugar had a number three country hit with Baker s I m Gonna Love you , and Mickey Gilley s version of Knight s Don t The Girls All Get Prettier At Closing Time topped the country charts and won the Academy of Country Music s Song Of The Year award .\nIn 1985 Baker contracted infectious mononucleosis for the second time as an adult .\nIt progressed into what is now termed the Chronic Fatigue \\/ Fibromyalgia Syndrome .\nAlthough this illness greatly limited Knight s activities , including his ability to record in commercial studios , he had a small facility built in his house and continued writing and recording songs .\nLast year , Baker released his first-ever solo CD , The Way I Hear It , which contains twelve songs that he s written during the past decade , plus his own interpretation of Lonesome Town .\nBaker sang every vocal part , produced , arranged , and engineered this labor of love that took nearly three years to complete .\nAmong the standout tracks are the ballads , I Can t Leave You Even Though You re Gone , You re the Only One That I Still Look For In A Crowd , and a humorous commentary on so-called technological advancements called The Computer Is Down .\nThese songs along with his newest CD , Music is My Woman , and his first all-instrumental CD , Music for Romantic Dreamers illustrate that after 40-plus years in the business , Knight still has his gift of melody and talented way with words .\nBaker Knight s CD is available through his website as well as on Amazon.com .\nOver the course of his career , Baker has received two Million Performance Award certifications from BMI Broadcast Music Incorporated for Lonesome Town , and Never Be Anyone Else But You , while The Wonder Of You recently received certification for two million performances !\nKnight also has eight BMI Citation of Achievement awards to his credit .\nIn addition to his success as a songwriter , Baker Knight s personal life has been blessed with two children .\nHis daughter , Tuesday Lynn Knight , is perhaps best known for her lead role as Kristen Parker in the horror flick Nightmare On Elm Street 4 , while his son , Thomas Baker Knight III , is a doctor of Veterinary medicine and an award-winning taxidermist who resides in Florida .\nLast August 28th , I had the pleasure of speaking with Baker Knight via telephone from his home in Alabama .\nHe was more than eager to share anecdotes about some of the songs he wrote for Dean Martin as well as personal insights into the man himself .\nI began by asking him how he started writing songs for Dino .\nI was in a Sherman Oaks pool hall one afternoon , and I was kinda bemoaning problems with my marriage not working out .\nSome of it was because I worked at night .\nAnyway , I walked out of the pool hall , and there was this beautiful girl riding in a car .\nAnd she just craned her neck all the way around to look at me like she just saw an ice cream sundae or something !\nAnd I said , Good Lord , somewhere there s a someone for everyone ; I know it !\nThe Next two songs of yours that Dean recorded were One Lonely Boy and Nobody s Baby Again .\nI think a lot of the songs I wrote around this time were about my marriage not working out .\nIt just wasn t the most pleasant thing for either one of us ; we just weren t cut out for each other .\nBut we have a beautiful daughter and still talk and get along to this day .\nDean recorded If I Ever Get Back To Georgia on the Happiness Is Dean Martin album At the time , he was into country-type stuff and we were trying to come up with something that might be considered in that vein .\nI think that s why I came up with that one .\nYou know humorist George Grizzard wrote a book titled If I ever Get Back To Georgia I m Gonna Nail My Feet To The Ground .\nHe liked one of my other songs and wrote about it a couple of times in his column , so I think he got the title for his book from that song .\nA Place In The Shade reminded me a lot of Bumming Around .\nYeah , that was kinda my idea .\nI loved the way Dean sang ; he really enjoyed singing , you could tell .\nYou know , he didn t really care for people who got up there and tried to make every note clear and perfect .\nSo , I just tried to get into his groove as well as I could .\nThat Old Time Feelin and Not Enough Indians were both on the Gentle On My Mind album .\nI think Feelin was the best song of mine that Dean recorded ; he liked it , too .\nI was at the session , and arranger Ernie Freeman put these horn licks after each line sings the cliched horn part and I just thought , Oh , man , this is ruining it .\nIf he could only have put some nice Floyd Cramer-type piano fills in there instead of those horns .\nYou know , not to ham it up .\nI was just cringing , but I couldn t say anything .\nI really think the song would ve had some notoriety if it was done without the horn licks .\nBut , Ernie was a great arranger .\nThat s just my own thoughts on that one .\nAnd Not Enough Indians was definitely about my marriage .\nDean got a kick out of that song .\nYou could tell when he was singing it .\nThat war whoop at the end of the song was an original ad lib on Dean s part .\nYou wrote three tracks on Dean s I Take A Lot Of Pride In What I Am LP .\nOne Cup Of Happiness And One Piece Of Mind was spelled piece on the record jacket , but peace on both the 45 and album labels .\nWhich one is correct , and also was the song based on any particular event in your life ?\nWell it had the double meaning of piece peace when I did it , but I wrote it as piece .\nI can t remember any specific incident .\nBut as a writer , you ve always got to have your antennae up .\nIf You Ever Get Around To Loving Me was one of my favorites ; it was a warm song .\nAnd on The Sneaky Little Side Of Me I was just trying to work into his personality and write something that he might like .\nHe had done a couple other things kinda like that , you know , playing the field .\nI thought that there might be a sneaky side of him , who knows ?\nlaughter The final tune of yours that Dean recorded was The Right Kind Of Woman .\nOf all the songs I wrote for him , I thought that was the biggest clunker .\nThe night that was recorded , Dean had agreed to let some people come in to the studio and watch him .\nThere was sort of an audience there ; my wife , people from Bowen s office , and people that I knew .\nAnd Dean was having a little trouble getting the song .\nAnd I m just sitting over there sweating cause I knew that the song wasn t that good .\nSo , Bowen went over and straightened out whatever problem it was that Dean was having with it .\nHe Bowen was just about to can it , and I think they didn t because some of the people there had come to cheer me on .\nI think Bowen was really trying to give me a helping hand .\nBut I still have to pull the covers over my head when I hear that song .\nAccording to the Warner Brothers Archives , Dean also recorded two of your songs at Hollywood Sound that were never released .\nWhat can you tell me about Do You Think It s Time ?\nWell , I remember the song sings I think it s time we try again .\nYeah , that was a good one .\nHow About I Can Remember ?\nOh , that was one of my favorite tunes .\nI think I submitted those songs for him .\nBut I m really skeptical about that session information .\nI think they the Warner Brothers archives might ve gotten some of the demos that I did for Dean mixed up with his actual recordings .\nAuthor s note Baker is correct .\nAs the recently released Bear Family box set illustrates the August 18 , 1970 session , long thought to be unreleased Dino tracks are actually Baker s demos for Dean .\nYou mentioned that you attended Dean s recording sessions .\nWhat were they like ?\nDean was really a pro .\nIt only took him two days to record an album .\nIn the afternoon , Bowen would bring the band in .\nAnd the orchestra and background singers would go down every song he was gonna record that night .\nSo they would have it pretty well polished and ready to go before Dean ever walked in .\nHe d come in about eight at night and park his Aston - Martin in front of the door .\nHe d do one or two takes and he was out of there !\nIt was a very smart way to record .\nBowen would have to pay for double sessions for everybody , but it worked .\nDean never gave more than two or three takes .\nHe d just lay it right down .\nIt wasn t like most other sessions where you hear the arrangement on the spot and the singer gets used to it and then they all do it together .\nSince the band was already rehearsed , that was a big plus for everybody .\nI remember Bowen would get out there right in the middle of the room and and slam his foot on the floor for the downbeat and count One !\nTwo !\nThree !\nI used to get a kick out of that .\nHe d shake that whole damn orchestra up in no time !\nFinally , is there anything else about working with Dean that you d like to mention ?\nHe was always very nice to me .\nI never saw him the slightest bit inebriated .\nHe was always dressed immaculately ; like he stepped off a magazine ad or something .\nAnd he had these loafer-like shoes , kinda like slippers .\nThey were black velvet with a gold , red , and black crest on them .\nAnd I was really impressed with his Aston - Martin ; they were way up there cost-wise , even in those days .\nHe was really one hell of a guy .\nSpecial thanks to Dean Martin historian and author , John Chintala .\nSpecial Thanks to Baker Knight , who s incredible talent continues to brighten our lives everyday !\nCopyright Dean Martin Fan Center et all For more information on Dean Martin , visit the Dean Martin Fan Center online .\nBaker Knight\n',062
'martygrant.com Marty and Karla Grant Home What s New Surnames Search Christian Books Help Contact Me Hiram Baker c1804 and Nancy -- of Ashe and Macon County , North Carolina and Union County , Georgia Home -RRB- Surnames -RRB- Baker -RRB- Hiram Baker Children Researcher List Register Report A Note about sources How to contact me Home The author Marty Grant is not related to Hiram Baker as far as can be proven .\nIt is possible that he is a son or grandson of my ancestor Jacob Baker 1760\\/65 .\nHiram Baker was born ca 1803\\/04 per his age of 46 on the 1850 census .\nHis second 1850 census entry showed him as age 45 , or born ca 1804\\/05 .\nThose match each other pretty closely .\nOther researchers give his birth as 1807 for some reason , though I don t know the source for that .\nIt doesn t match either of his 1850 census entries .\nHiram was born in Ashe Co. , NC as proven by his 1850 census entry .\nThe Macon County census taker very helpfully included the county of birth for everyone , and not just the state .\nI don t know who Hiram Baker s parents are .\nI have theorized that he was a son of my ancestor Jacob Baker 1760\\/65 since one of Jacob s daughters also moved to Macon County .\nI have also theorized that Hiram is a son of Thomas Baker 1765-1831 since they lived near each other in 1830 , and Hiram did name his oldest son Thomas Baker .\nOther researchers lists Hiram as a son of Zachariah Baker 1775\\/80 , which is probably based on Hiram living near Zachariah s widow in 1840 .\nA note about DNA Test Results A descendant of Hiram Baker via his son Thomas Baker has taken the DNA test .\nHis results do not match any other Bakers yet .\nHe does not match the Thomas Baker 1711-1777 group , which is where he should be if Hiram were a son of Thomas 1765-1831 .\nHe also does not match other descendants of Zachariah Baker though only one is in the test database so far .\nSince there is only one Zachariah descendant in the database , and only one Hiram descendant , we can t draw any solid conclusions .\nWe will know more when there are two or more from each line .\nAdditional note The DNA test in question was a 12 marker test , which generally isn t enough to go on .\nApparently it is an 11\\/12 match with members of the Thomas Baker 1711-1777 group .\nIf the test is expanded to 25 or 37 perhaps then we will know more .\nSince we have no real proof of Hiram s parentage , some census analysis might help .\nHowever , due to the large number of Bakers in Ashe County , census analysis doesn t really help much at all .\nFor the 1810 census , Hiram would have been about 5 years old , so he should be enumerated in the under 10 age group born 1800-1810 .\nAll of the Baker families listed in Ashe County that year had an apparent son that age .\nOne of these could be Hiram s father .\nUnfortunately the census taker that year only used initials , so it is difficult to know who was who J. Baker , probably James Baker 1775\\/80 had three sons that age ; Z. Baker , likely Zachariah Baker 1775\\/80 had one son that age ; another J. Baker still unidentified had five sons that age ; another J. Baker , probably John W. Baker 1783 had two sons that age ; S. Baker , likely Samuel Baker 1755\\/65 had four sons that age ; M. Baker , likely Morris Baker bef 1755 had one son that age ; and finally , another S. Baker , likely Solomon Baker 1770 had two sons that age .\nAs you can see the 1810 census does not narrow down the list of possible parents for Hiram Baker , for every Baker household in the county that year had at least one son of approximately the same age .\nIn 1820 Hiram Baker would probably still be home with his parents .\nHe should have been enumerated in either the 16-25 age group born ca 1794\\/1804 or in the 10-15 age group born ca 1804\\/10 , depending on what his actual birth date was .\nJacob Baker 1760\\/65 , my ancestor , had one apparent son in each of those age groups ; James Baker 1775\\/80 had two sons of matching ages ; Jonathan Baker 1775\\/80 had three possible matching sons ; Thomas Baker 1760\\/65 had one matching son ; Zachariah Baker 1775\\/80 had one matching son ; Elijah Baker 1794\\/1800 had one matching male , and John Baker 1783 had one matching son .\nLike the 1810 census , the 1820 census does not help narrow down the suspects too much .\nHiram Baker married Nancy -- just before 1830 in Ashe Co , NC .\nGeorge Windes a descendant of Hiram and Nancy thinks Nancy s maiden name may have been Ray .\nHe may be correct , as Ray was a well known name in Ashe County , and that family was associated with some of the other Baker s there .\nHowever , Ralphe Baker , another descendant of Hiram says that Nancy was a Saunders .\nI don t know which is correct , if either .\nI ve not seen evidence either way .\nHiram Baker was listed on the 1830 census very close to the Thomas Baker family could be his father .\nOn this census , he was listed as Hiram Jr , as there was an older Hiram Baker in the same county a cousin probably who was about 10 years older .\n1830 census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census 1830 Ashe Co , NC pg 12 Hiram Baker Jr 2000100000000-0000100000000 Analysis 1 Male s 20-29 1800-1810 Hiram BAKER 1803\\/04 2 Male s 0-4 1825-1830 Son ?\n1825\\/30 -- -RRB- gone by 1840 Thomas BAKER 1829\\/30 son 1 Female s 20-29 1800-1810 Nancy Baker 1802\\/03 wife Hiram was still in Ashe Co , NC for the 1840 census .\nThis time he was just two households from a widow Sally Baker .\nShe might be the widow of Zachariah Baker .\nIf so , this proximity may be why some think Hiram is a son of Zachariah .\nI can understand that .\n1840 census analysis based on available evidence Explanation of this census 1840 Ashe Co , NC pg 17 Hiram Baker 2210010000000-0100010000000 Analysis 1 Male s 30-39 1800-1810 Hiram BAKER 1803\\/04 1 Male s 10-14 1825-1830 Thomas BAKER 1829\\/30 son 2 Male s 5-9 1830-1835 Son ?\n1830\\/35 -RRB- gone by 1850 Son ?\n1830\\/35 -RRB- gone by 1850 2 Male s 0-4 1835-1840 William BAKER 1836\\/37 son Henry BAKER 1838\\/39 son 1 Female s 30-39 1800-1810 Nancy Baker 1802\\/03 wife 1 Female s 5-9 1830-1835 Elizabeth BAKER 1830\\/31 daughter Hiram Baker and family left Ashe Co , NC sometime between 1845 and 1850 and moved to Macon Co , NC .\nFor some reason they were listed on the 1850 census in Macon Co , NC and in nearby Union Co , GA the same year .\nIt is clearly the same family , but the listings are slightly different .\nIn Macon County they were about 50 houses from Mary Margaret Baker Fouts daughter of Jacob Baker .\nIn 1850 Macon Co , NC , Hiram s married daughter Elizabeth and her husband Joseph Hampton were residing with them .\nIn their 1850 Union Co , GA listing , they were not with them , nor listed separately in that county .\nIn 1850 , Macon County , NC and Union County , GA were fairly close together , though not quite bordering each other , but pretty close .\nHiram s family were the only Bakers in Macon County in 1850 excluding Mary Margaret Baker Fouts mentioned above .\n1850 census abstract Explanation of this census Note The dates at the end of each line are not part of the original census , but are approximate birth years based on age 1850 MACON CO , NC Page 337 House \\/ Family # 295 \\/ 301 -- TENNESSEE VALLEY Twp Enumerated 1 Sep 1850 BAKER HIRAM 46 M W FARMER ASHE CO , NC 1803\\/1804 BAKER NANCY 47 F W ASHE CO , NC 1802\\/1803 HAMPTON ELIZABETH 19 F W ASHE CO , NC 1830\\/1831 BAKER WILLIAM 13 M W ASHE CO , NC 1836\\/1837 BAKER HENRY 11 M W ASHE CO , NC 1838\\/1839 BAKER MARY 9 F W ASHE CO , NC 1840\\/1841 BAKER NANCY 5 F W ASHE CO , NC 1844\\/1845 HAMPTON JOSEPH 20 M W FARMER RUTHERFORD CO , NC 1829\\/1830 HAMPTON THOMAS 0 M W 4\\/12 BUNCOMBE CO , NC 1849\\/1850 HAMPTON RACHEL 8 F W BUNCOMBE CO , NC 1841\\/1842 1850 UNION CO , GA Page House \\/ Family # 813 \\/ 813 Enumerated 1 Nov 1850 BAKER HIRAM 45 M W NC 1804\\/1805 BAKER NANCY 46 F W NC 1803\\/1804 BAKER THOMAS 20 M W NC 1829\\/1830 BAKER WILLIAM 12 M W NC 1837\\/1838 BAKER HENRY 8 M W NC 1841\\/1842 BAKER MARY 7 F W NC 1842\\/1843 BAKER NANCY 5 F W NC 1844\\/1845 There was only one other Baker family in Union Co. , GA in 1850 Daniel Baker age 40 , born NC and wife Jincy age 24 , NC and their one child Susannah 5 months , born GA. .\nThey were about 60 or so households from Hiram , so not particularly close .\nDaniel was in Polk Co. , TN by 1860 .\nGeorge Windes told me that Hiram Baker and family moved to Winston Co , Alabama and was listed there on the 1860 census .\nI checked that out and it is correct .\nI have not researched the family beyond this point .\nChildren of Hiram and Nancy -- Baker .\nHiram Baker and Nancy had several children per the 1830 through 1850 census records .\nSee the register report for additional information .\nResearcher List Persons researching this family click here for data on how to get on or off of this list George Windes = Hiram - Thomas - Register Report 1 .\nHiram1 Baker , born 1803\\/04 in Ashe Co , NC ;

A century ago the name was read as salkeld .\nThe accuracy of this reading is borne out by the appearance of that name , afterwards erased and replaced by sackvell , on one of the two remaining copies of the Crown Office list ; the other and later copy has sackveld alone .\nIt is thus possible that a Thomas Salkeld , presumably of the prominent Westmoreland family of that name , was elected but was afterwards superseded by Sackville .\nWhat is more likely , however , is that Sackville was elected and that instead of his unfamiliar name its near counterpart was entered on the return , to be copied on the Crown Office list and only corrected when Sackville appeared in the House .\nWho procured his election is a matter of speculation .\nNeither he nor his fellow-knight Anthony Kempe , another Sussex man , had any standing in Westmoreland , but both could claim a marriage connection with Henry Clifford , 2 Earl of Cumberland , hereditary sheriff of the county , and with his father-in-law the 3rd Lord Dacre of Gillesland ; Cumberland must also have had dealings with both Sackville s father , and ex-chancellor or augmentations , and his father-in-law Sir John Baker , one of whom doubtless made the approach .\nFor Sackville , as for Kempe , a knighthood of the shire was not to recur ; he was to sit as a burgess in the first two Elizabethan Parliaments and in the third he took his seat in the Lords .\nSackville had appeared on the pardon roll in Oct 1553 as of London .\nOn 8 Mar 1557 , together with Thomas Swynton , he purchased various properties in Kent and Sussex for 1,221 .\nIn co-operation with Thomas Norton he wrote The Tragedie of Gorboduc but he handed over his other literary project A myrroure for magistrates to George Ferrers and William Baldwin after completing the Introduction .\nIn 1558 upon the death of Queen Mary ; her half sister Elizabeth Tudor , third cousin on her mother Anne Boleyn s side ; ascended England s throne .\nIn addition during the year of 1561 he received the title of Grandmaster of the Order of Freemasons .\nIn 1563 he was once again elected to Parliament this time for Aylesbury .\nWhen he became thirty one years of age , he was knighted and raised to peerage as Lord Buckhurst which did take place on the eighth day of Jun of that year .\nOne year prior to receiving the title of Lord Buckhurst ; Queen Elizabeth awarded a piece of property to keeping known as Knole .\nMuch of the fabric of Knole dates from the second half of the fifteenth century .\nOn 30 Jun 1456 William Fiennes sold the estate 266 13s 4d to Thomas Bourchier , Archbishop of Canterbury and for a brief period in 1455-6 , Lord Chancellor of England .\nBetween that date and his death in 1486 , Bourchier built himself a substantial but relatively austere palace grouped around a series of courtyards , and containing all of the elements that one would expect to see in the house of an important medieval prelate - a great hall with a day parlor and first-floor solar at one end and kitchens and domestic offices at the other , a chapel , and lodgings for his large household .\nWhen Bourchier died - at Knole - he left the estate to the See of Canterbury , and it functioned as an archiepiscopal palace until 1538 , when Henry VIII bullied Thomas Cranmer into presenting it to the Crown .\nThe King considerably enlarged the house by building three new ranges of lodgings and a turreted and crenellated gatehouse in the front of the Archbishop s original gatehouse , thus forming what is now known as the Green Court , the main entrance court at Knole .\nAfter his death , the house went through a rather confused series of occupancies .\nEdward VI assigned it to John Dudley , Duke of Northumberland , who for some reason returned it two years later .\nMary he granted it to Cardinal Pole for life in 1556 ; when he died in Nov 1558 on the same day as the Queen it reverted to the Crown .\nElizabeth granted it to John Dudley s son , Robert , Earl of Leicester , who promptly sublet it , before returning it , still sublet in 1566 .\nIn Jun 1566 the Queen presented the estate to his keeping , under whom Knole has finally settled down to a more stable period of ownership .\nBut throughout his career as one of her Majesty s chief advisers , he had been unable to even live at Knole , in the stead he had managed replace the old Archbishop s palace with a Theobalds or a Holdenby for his Queen s entertainment .\nAlthough he had been granted the house and estate in 1566 , it currently occupied by the Lennard family , tenants who had moved in as the Earl of Leicester handed the property back to the Crown .\nIn 1568 he had been commissioned to traveled to France on an official visit , his mission was to persuaded the Queen Mother to make a motion for the marriage of Elizabeth with her second son , the Duke of Anjou .\nIn 1569 at the age of thirty-three years old , he was honored to be placed in the office of Lord Lieutenant of Sussex .\nTwo years later in 1571 , he returned to France to congratulate Charles IX on his marriage afterwhich he did return to England bringing Paul du Foix along to continue the discussion of the impending marriage .\nAlso within that year he had been bestowed a Master of Arts from Cambridge .\nIn 1572 , he became a member of her Majesty s Privy Council and became employed as Commissioner at state trials .\nAs a member of her Majesty s Privy Council , he was considered a prot g e of William Cecil , Baron Burghley and he tends to agree with most of the issues Burghley is in favor of .\nHis career took Sackville to the treasurership and an Earldom before he died at the council table on 19 Apr 1608 .\nThe Somerset House Conference , 1604 Juan de Velasco Frias ;

'Home | | Descendants | | History | | Timeline Maps | | Pictures | | DNA Project | | Links | | Contact Us History of Thomas Baker Thomas Baker was born about 1737 , location unknown , and died September 29 , 1814 , in Estill Co. , Kentucky .\nThomas made his will the day before he died , listing children Jacob Baker ; the heirs of Joseph Baker ; Humphrey Baker ; William Baker ; the heirs of Thomas Baker Jr. ; and daughters , Betsy Nix , Polly Bell , Sally Hubbard , and Caty Baker .\nAt this time it is unknown who the wife or wives of Thomas Baker were .\nIn 1752 , Thomas moved to future Washington County Virginia with his parents , where 436 acres was surveyed for Humphrey on April 9 , 1753 , on Stalnakers Creek , today s Hutton Creek , near the present town of Glade Spring .\nThe land which lay on both sides of the creek included the path over Walker Mountain to the North fork of the Holston and beyond and northwest of Stalnaker , who had settled on Indian fields in 1750 .\nThis made Humphrey the western most settler at the time .\nStalnaker only had a lease to crop for his trading post settlement .\nHistorian J. Allen Neal in his bicentennial history of Washington County , Virginia incorrectly concluded that the Stalnaker settlement was west of that of Baker that Hutton Creek was Stalnaker s Creek and Baker s Creek was the stream that follows the Smyth - Washington County line .\nActually , Stalnaker s Creek , Baker s Creek , and the present day Hutton s Creek , are one and the same , depending on which period of history is being considered .\nThe survey from patents and deeds confirm it .\nFor many years after 1752 , the Baker settlement was the farthest outpost of the frontier .\nThomas served as a member of the Bedford Co. , Virginia , militia at the height of the first phase of the French and Indian War in 1758 .\nHe received pay in 1759 for his services as a soldier at Fort Fauquier on the James River as a member of Col. John Buchanan s Company .\nHe was a member , as was his father , of Capt.\nAlexander Sayer s Troop of Horse Company .\nThomas , along with his father Humphrey and family , returned to their 436 acres of land on the Middle Fork of the Holston River about 1766\\/67 .\nIn 1770 Thomas was listed as tithable next to his father Humphrey and brothers John and George in Botetourt Co. . later Fincastle \\/ Washington Co. , VA .\nIn April of 1773 Thomas signed a petition to call Presbyterian minister , Rev.\nCummings , to Sinking Spring and Ebbing Springs churches in Washington County .\nIn 1774 Thomas was surveyed for 328 acres on Reedy Hill Creek , South Fork of the Holston River near present Needmore , VA , a few miles from Humphrey s land .\nThomas served as a spy under Colonel Andrew Lewis command during Lord Dunmore s War in 1774 .\nHe was wounded in the left arm and right hip at the Battle of Point Pleasant in October 1774 He later received a pension from the State of Virginia for these wounds while living his last years in Estill Co. , Kentucky .\nThomas is listed on the monument at Point Pleasant W \\/ V honoring the soldiers who participated in the Battle at Point Pleasant in 1774 .\nThomas is not listed in the 1782 tax list of Washington Co. , Virginia , though his father Humphrey and brothers , John , George , Robert , and Alexander , are .\nIt is believed , but not proven , that he was in the area of Madison Co. , Kentucky , at that time .\nThomas is on the first tax list , 1787 , of the newly formed Madison County .\nThomas purchased 150 acres on Tate s Creek and 200 acres on Muddy Creek in Madison County .\nHe also paid taxes on his father s 449 acres of land , located at Station Camp Creek on the Kentucky River .\nResearch has found a Thomas Baker , who served 3 years as a soldier in the Virginia State Artillery during the Revolutionary War .\nIn 1783 this Thomas Baker received a Military Warrant for 100 acres of land in Kentucky .\nThis may , indeed , be our Thomas Baker , but further research is needed to prove or disprove this finding .\nTranscript of Thomas Baker s Will .\nDescendants of Thomas Baker Generation No. .\n1 1 .\nTHOMAS 4 BAKER HUMPHREY3 , WILLIAM2 , THOMAS1 was born Abt .\n1737 in VA , and died September 29 , 1814 in Estill Co. .

album , One Way Ticket to Hell And Back , included the exhaustion and the fear , the pressure , paranoia and pan pipes , the breakdowns and the breakups , the sackings , sitar solos and endless studio sessions .\nMix will leave the paranoia , breakdowns and sackings to the tabloids , but we definitely want to know more about the endless studio sessions .\nThe man in the know is Roy Thomas Baker , the legendary producer behind pioneering albums by Queen , The Cars , Journey , Foreigner , Devo and many , many more .\nThe pairing of Baker and The Darkness is a marriage made in heaven , and has been in the cards ever since the band entered the public consciousness with Permission to Land , which sold some 3.5 million copies in 2003 .\nTake a lead singer dis - graced with leotard suits and a balls-in-the-bench-vice falsetto , add music that takes its inspiration from 1970s hard rock , season with lots of operatic pomp , and you have a band that can lay claim to being the 21st-century heirs to the likes of Led Zeppelin , Queen , AC \\/ DC , Slade and other rock bands from rock s golden age .\nBaker s name , meanwhile , will forever be associated with Queen albums such as Queen II and Night at the Opera , which contained the track Bohemian Rhapsody , the band s ode to rock n roll bombast , and was filled to the brim with overdubs .\nIt was the highpoint of what Baker calls his kitchen sink production time Any idea that we had , we just threw it on .\nIt looks as if Baker has revived his kitchen sink production approach with The Darkness .\nAnd how .\nOn the phone from his studio near Lake Havasu , Ariz. , Baker frequently roars with laughter as he describes the Spinal Tap like excesses that went into the creation of One Way Ticket to Hell And Back .\nThey include 50-odd guitars in the control room Don t touch em , don t even point at em !\n, up to 160 guitar overdubs per song and a similar number of vocal overdubs , orchestras , bagpipes , a sitar and , yes , a pan flute .\nEverything ended up on 400 reels of 24-track tape , and some songs expanded to 1,000 !\ntracks before they were whittled down to 72 tracks for final mixing .\nIt truly boggles the mind and begs for the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth .\nPre-production for One Way Ticket to Hell And Back began in earnest in October 2004 , when Baker flew over to the UK to work with the band .\nThey are pretty unique songwriters , and they churn out a song a minute , recalls Baker .\nWe had what seemed like thousands of songs .\nThe whole purpose for me as a producer in being there was to work out what the best parts were and help evolve them .\nWe were working arrangements out as we went along , and ended up with very clear ideas of the kind of arrangements that we wanted .\nIn the beginning of 2005 , Baker and band moved to Rockfield Studios in Wales , where the producer had cut Bohemian Rhapsody .\nThe Darkness hired both studios for the first half of 2005 , and for several months , Baker had the band over a barrel , recording the backing tracks mostly drums , bass and rhythm guitars in endless different configurations and locations , all to get the densely , subtly and richly textured sound he was after .\nThe story goes that you had as many as 120 overdubs in some songs .\nOh , of course , there were at least 120 guitar parts in many of the songs !\nDan Hawkins , the band s rhythm guitarist has a lot of different guitars , and so we went , Okay , the first half of this verse sounds good on this guitar , but why don t we change to a different guitar in the second half and then go back to the first guitar for the chorus , but in a different tuning , or with different strings , or a different amplifier , or a different microphone and so on .\nBy the time we multitracked all those , we ended up with up to 160 guitar parts on a good deal of the songs .\nIf you listen closely , one set of guitars will come in and then a totally different set of guitars and then yet another set of guitars .\nIn some places , there may be a bunch of guitars that comes in for just two seconds .\nProducer Roy Thomas Baker , the man behind the endless studio sessions , has worked on numerous rock records .\nphoto Jim Steinfeldt That sounds like a massive amount of work .\nHow did you keep that in focus when working with the guitarist ?\nI like to have the guitarist and all his guitars and his amplifiers in the control room so the guitars are all at the same temperature and you never spend half an hour waiting for a guitar to stabilize and remain in tune .\nI also can have complete communication with the guitarist all the time .\nWith the sound coming back from the monitors , you instantly know whether you have the right sound or not .\nDan had between 40 and 50 guitars in the control room during this stage of the recording .\nThe amp heads are all in the control room because it s far better to push a signal than to pull it ; running a short lead from the guitar to the guitar amp is better than running a long lead from control room to studio .\nWe had the speaker cabinets outside the control room , wired in such a way that we could connect any amp head to any cabinet each lead was marked and also had all the cabinets in different rooms .\nThe microphones could be everywhere hung from the ceiling , lying on the floor and so on but we often had dynamic mics for close-up and antique tube-like mics for ambient .\nThe microphones themselves were of every conceivable vintage and make , and we had everything ready to record via a preamp of our choice .\nAfter the Rockfield period you went to Whitfield Street Studios in London .\nWhat did you do there ?\nJustin Hawkins lead guitar and vocals , keyboards not many people know that he s one of the world s best keyboard players and the bagpipes .\nDuring the vocal recording , Justin was in the recording area , just behind the glass .\nWe used the full ambience of the studio itself , and I put a whole slew of microphones around him he looked a little bit like the president does during a press conference !\nAll the mics went to the Neve mic pre s , which have a great sound .\nBecause I could have the mic pre s next to where Justin was singing , the signals were pushed into the control room , which gives a much better S \\/ N ratio .\nWe might use one or two or six microphones at all sorts of different levels , EQ settings and so on to get the right vocal sound for a part of a given song .\nSometimes , each line of each verse would have a different sound .\nI would also run his voice through a compressor , like a Fairchild or , something I particularly like , a Tube - Tech compressor going into a Tube - Tech EQ .\nOn a track like Blind Man , we could have 160 vocal overdubs , with me changing the sound of every part , especially the low ones .\nAll this may sound a bit complicated , but it ended up being excessively slick .\nObviously , his voice would sometimes get tired and then he would go on to playing keyboards or guitar .\nYou also recorded an orchestra at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles on 50-odd tracks .\nHow much material did you end up with ?\nOh , I filled about 400 reels of 24-track tape .\nWe must have used the world s entire supply of tape at the time !\nWe were trying to get a hold of more tape because we were wiping tapes that we had already used to make space for new overdubs .\nWe had bunches of slaves .\nWe might have a whole slew of guitars on one slave and then submix those to two tracks on another slave and carry on overdubbing onto that one .\nWe were always submixing and bouncing backward and forward .\nIt was very , very time-consuming .\nHow on earth did you organize all that material ?\nWe were making a massive-sounding type of record .\nWe were going for a huge , huge production sound ; hence , all the overdubs .\nBut we did not want to make a retro record .\nWe wanted to get the best of both worlds , of old and new .\nI wanted to make a modern record .\nSince the aim was to go for the big , hybrid sound , we used analog 24-track to record on and then transferred everything to Pro Tools | HD and did our editing in there .\nI like utilizing the best aspects of both .\nIt sounds like doing everything in Pro Tools from the start would have made life much easier for you .\nAnalog gives you a nice , full texture that you can not get any other way .\nWhen recording on analog , I make sure that the levels are at full tilt and the red lights are flashing .\nI press it exceptionally hard .\nFor this reason , I don t need to use Dolby .\nWe align the tapes so that everything is just on the verge of distorting , and the tape acts like a giant compressor .\nIt s why I don t like to use outboard compressors during the recording stage because you stop the sound of tape compression from happening .\nYou mixed at the The Village in Los Angeles .\nWhy ?\nI know the studio inside out and I really like mixing on their Neve 88 R. I felt it was good to mix on something that s discrete I m a big fan of Neve .\nWe did a lot of sub-bouncing inside of Pro Tools before mixing .\nSome tracks had loads and loads of guitars and vocals , and we d end up with 1,000 tracks otherwise .\nThat s impossible , so we got everything down to 72 tracks .\nWe then set Pro Tools up with the Neve 88 R and started mixing .\nI don t like mixing inside of Pro Tools because it feels a bit Mickey Mouse to me when you need a cursor to push up and down faders and so on .\nCan you describe the mixing process ?\nFor me , mixing is mainly balancing and giving the final tweaks sound-wise .\nSince I don t add much compression during recording , I may add compression .\nI ll be using old and new stuff during mixing , like Fairchild , Summit or Tube - Tech .\nInstead of sticking a Lexicon on the vocals , I used natural echo echo chambers , plates or slap tape echo .\nAnd we mixed the album to half-inch analog on an Ampex 2-track and also back into Pro Tools as a comparison .\nWe listened to both and found that the analog had a nice , big , saturated bass sound , while the digital had a really nice crispy top end .\nWe ended up using the analog mix for mastering , adding some treble to make it sound as sparkling at the top end as the digital did .\nAgain , about the excessive amount of material that you amassed How did you keep a clear head over what s good and what s bad ?\nYou have to be mentally organized and make very good notes of everything you do .\nThere were recording engineers who made sure that it all got to tape and who did the transfers to Pro Tools , which was also a task .\nBut for me , there s no risk of not seeing the trees for the wood .\nIt s totally the opposite .\nYou get focused on what you think is appropriate for a song , and then you tune into different microphones and preamps and EQs and so on .\nYou have to know what your goal is .\nThe band and I had discussed beforehand what we planned to do , and we mapped it out before we went into the studio .\nOf course it changes ; it always changes .\nIn the studio , you re running 100 percent on instinct , and you sometimes end up with something that s a lot better than you had planned .\nBut the structure of every song on the album is exactly the way it was planned out to be .\nWe had a vision of how the record was going to pan out , and we stuck to that vision , unless happy accidents happened .\nAnd I think we pulled it off .\nWant to use this article ?\nClick here for options !\n2006 Prism Business Media Inc. .

'BAKER FAMILY HISTORY GENEALOGY From A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family In 1979 Dorothy Merrifield wrote a book entitled A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family .\nThis book is no longer in print ; therefore , for the benefit of descendants of Moses Baker in their quest to find information on this family , I will attempt to include a small part of the book on this web page .\nThe book is 183 pages long and I am in possession of photocopies of only a portion of this book .\nThe book is no longer in print .\nIf you have any information to add to the information below , please contact me at CMElaine@aol.com Thanks !\nElaine Powell The introduction of the book reads as follows . . Much has been written about the early Bakers of Nansemond , Isle of Wight and Surry Counties , Virginia and of Gates , Chowan and Bertie Counties , North Carolina .\nJohn Bennett Boddie in his books Southside Virginia Families , Vol .\n1 , Virginia Historical Genealogies and Seventeenth Century Isle of Wight County , Virginia has devoted many pages to the families of Lawrence and Henry Baker .\nBodie suggest that the Bakers were from Sussex and Kent , England and that they first settled in Virginia in the early seventeenth century .\nLawrence Baker was granted land in Surry County , Virginia in 1650 .\nHe was a member of the House of Burgesses from 1666 to 1676 .\nHe died in 1681 and left his estate to his widow Elizabeth and his daughter Catherine , who was the wife of Arthur Allen .\nBoddie SS p 5 .\nA Henry Baker was also a resident of Surry and he patented land in 1683 .\nHe died in 1700 , leaving his estate to his wife Sarah and his children .\nHis daughters were Rebecca , Mary , Susan and Elizabeth .\nHis sons were Henry , Edward and William .\nBoddie doesn t attempt to establish a proven relationship between Lawrence Baker and Henry Baker , but it is very likely that they were either brothers or father and son .\nIbid .\nBoddie continues with the family of Henry Baker of Isle of Wight County , Virginia .\nHe suggests that Henry of Isle of Wight may have been the son of Henry who died in Surry County , Virginia in 1700 .\nBoddie believed that Mary Baker Henry s wife was a daughter of John Blake of Nansemond County , Virginia , but in the year 1914 , Ex - Judge B.\nB. Winborne , a descendant of Henry Baker , wrote an article about this family which was published in the 1968 summer issue of the North Carolina Genealogy , pp 2114-2134 , and it was his belief that Henry Baker married Mary Bennett , one of the daughters of Edward Bennett of Isle of Wight County , Virginia .\nEdward Bennett had another daughter named Sylvester or Sylvestra who married Major Nicholas Hill .\nHenry Baker was a wealthy merchant and when he died in 1712 he left a large estate to his wife and children .\nThe names of his children were Henry , James , Lawrence , William , Sarah , Mary , Catherine and Elizabeth .\nThe land that he devised to his sons Henry , William and Lawrence fell within the boundaries of Chowan Precinct , North Carolina and when Hertford County was established their lands were within the boundaries of Hertford County , North Carolina .\nNCG pp 2114-2123 , 1969 .\nFor more information about this early and very interesting family the reader is referred to the books mentioned below .\nThis book is about the family of Moses Baker .\nA Moses Baker died in Isle of Wight County , Virginia prior to 1693 .\nHis widow Elizabeth married Edward Riddle .\nMoses Baker had at least one son , Moses Baker Jr. .\nIn 1693 , Moses Baker Jr. sued his stepfather , Edward Riddle , for the estate that his father Moses Baker Sr. had devised to him in his last Will and Testament .\nA few months later Edward and Elizabeth Riddle died and letters of administration were granted to Samuel Rollyson who had married Hannah Baker , one of Elizabeth s daughters .\nAn attachment was awarded to Moses Baker Jr. against Samuel Rollyson for many valuable articles , which had belonged to Moses Baker Sr. .\nIn one of his declarations , Moses Baker Jr. stated that he was the godson of Colonel John Powell and he also sued to recover the property devised to him by the last Will and Testament of Colonel Powell .\nBoddie IW p245 and VHG p 98 .\nThe next reference to Moses Baker was his marriage to Elizabeth Brown on January 12 , 1694 in Elizabeth City , Virginia .\nThirty years later he died .\nHis Will is recorded in Chowan County , North Carolina .\nHe left a wife , three sons and three daughters .\nThe following is an excerpt from his Will .\n.\nBeing very sick and weak in body but of perfect mind and memory . .\nI bequeath unto my well beloved wife all my estate during her natural life or widowhood only . to my three daughters , the cattal which are called theirs at the day of marrige . to my son Moses , my niegar fallows . to my son Benett my gun and belt . to my son William one cow and cow calf at the age of 15 , also a bed . the rest of my estate to be divided after my debts are paid . my friend Richard Minshen and my wife my whole and sole executors . . Wit Aaron Blanchard , Jurat , William Hill and William x Wesson , Jurat .\nChowan January Court 1724 .\nNCA WB 1 p 85 .\nPlease keep in mind the names of the witnesses to Moses Baker s Will .\nNotice that Moses Baker named his second son Benett .\nAs stated on the beginning page of this introduction , Mary Bennett married Henry Baker and Mary s sister Sylvester Bennett married Major Nicholas Hill .\nA Moses Hill died very early in Chowan County , North Carolina and left a Will , but it was said to be illegible .\nGrimes p 105 .\nWilliam Weston , who was one of the witnesses to Moses Baker s Will was married to Catherine Blanchard , daughter of Benjamin Blanchard .\nAn excerpt from the Will of Benjamin Blanchard follows .\nUpper part of Nansemond County .\nJune 5 , 1719 .\nBenjamin Blanchard .\nSons Robert Land on Beverdam Swamp in Chowan Precinct , N. C. Absalom .\nBenjamin Land on Beverdam .\nSon-in-law William Weston wife Catherine .\nExecutors Wife Catherine and son Robert .\nWits William Hill , James Grising , Thomas Roundtree .\nGrimes p 33 .\nWilliam Hill , also a witness to Moses Baker s Will , married Mary Spivey , a daughter of Thomas Spivey .\nWilliam Weston and Robert Blanchard witnessed Spevey s Will .\nMark Chapel was a legatee of Thomas Spivey .\nGrimes p 356 .\nA Richard Hill , died and left a Will in Craven County , North Carolina in 1729 .\nHis heirs were Daughter , Ann Jones ; son-in-law , Evan Jones ; granddaughter , Elizabeth Hill .\nExr Brother , Francis Hill .\nGrimes p 165 .\nOn page four of this book please note that Margaret 14 , daughter of Michael 2 Baker , married a man named Evan Jones .\nThis Evan Jones was no doubt a grandson or grandnephew of the Evan Jones mentioned in the Will of Richard Hill .\nIn 1735 , Moses Baker was the executor of the Will of Richard Chappell .\nIt is assumed that this Moses Baker was the son mentioned in the Will of the Moses Baker who died in Chowan County , North Carolina in 1724 .\nAn Excerpt from the Will of Richard Chappell follows .\nChowan County , N. C. March 1734 .\nPro .\nOct. 1735 .\nRichad Chappel s Will suggests a close family relationship .\nHe may have been the brother of Eliza Chappell .\nWe know that Moses Baker married Elizabeth Brown in 1694 in Elizabeth City , Virginia and that he died in 1724 in Chowan County , mentioning three unnamed daughters in his Will .\nEliza may have been one of those .\nRichard Chappell named his eldest son , Moses , probably after Moses Baker .\nSince Richard Chappell didn t appoint his son Moses as his executor , it may be that he wasn t of legal age .\nBelow are abstracts of two deeds involving Moses and Bennett Baker .\nDB C p 193 .\nBertie Co. , N. C. Jan. 31 , 1748 .\nMoses Baker , Yeoman , sold to Benjamin Holleman 150 acres for 30 pounds , land on the east side of Chinkapin Creek , adjoining John Smith at Flatt Swamp and Kellum .\nWits John Wynns , John Smith , W. Evens .\nMay Ct . 1749 .\nBD C p 399 .\nBertie Co. , N. C. May 22 , 1751 .\nJohn Smith , yeoman , sold to Bennett Baker , miller , 200 acres for 30 pounds on the East side of Chinkapin Swamp adjoining land of James Holley bequeathed to Jane , his wife , by the last Will and Testament of our father John Smith , Deceased .\nAdjoining James Williams .\nWits John Wynns , John Freeman , Thomas Parker .\nBell pp200 and 216 .\nThese two deeds prove that Moses and Bennett Baker , sons of Moses Baker of Chowan County , North Carolina , owned land adjacent to each other on Chinkapin Creek in Bertie County which later was in Hertford County when that County was organised .\nThey lived in the same County as Henry and Lawrence Baker and were neighbors to James Williams .\nMoses Bake sold his land and moved to Edgecombe County , North Carolina .\nIn 1759 he witnessed the Will of George Williams .\nAn excerpt of that Will follows .\nEdgecombe Co. , N. C. July 19 , 1758 .\nPro .\nJune 1759 .\nWill of George Williams .\nSons George , Samuel .\nDau Cloe .\nDec d sister , Lucretia Williams .\nExtrix Wife Priscilla .\nWit George Crudup , Moses Baker and John Norwood .\nGrimes p 409 .\nMoses Baker who died in Edgecombe County , North Carolina in 1786 and who was the progenitor of our family , named his eldest son , Michael , perhaps after Michael Brinkley who witnessed the Will of Richard Chappell .\nHe named his second son , Aaron , after Aaron Blanchard who witnessed the Will of Moses Baker who died in 1724 in Chowan County .\nHis fourth son , Thomas , married Penelope Williams who was the daughter of Thomas and Margaret Williams .\nThomas and Margaret Williams also had a daughter named Priscilla .\nShe may have been named after the wife of George Williams .\nWatson , N. C. Estate Records , 1730-1820 .\nAll through the genealogy that follows you will find the names of Smith , Williams and Jones , the same family names associated with Moses Baker in Bertie and Edgecombe Counties , North Carolina .\nAlthough Henry Baker and Lawrence Baker lived in the same general area as Moses Baker in Chowan , Bertie and Hertford Counties of North Carolina , I have not found any evidence that they were related unless the relationship occurred in the early 1600 s in Nansemond and Isle of Wight Counties Virginia .\nThere seems to be no similarities of names carried on by the two families .\nAlthough I believe that Moses Baker who died in Edgecombe County , North Carolina is a descendant of Moses Baker who died in Chowan County , North Carolina in 1724 , despite all of the evidence , however interesting , I have been unable to prove a direct relationship .\nTherefore , I begin A Genealogical Record of the Moses Baker Family , 1708-1979 with Moses Baker of Edgecombe County , North Carolina .\nDorothy Merrifield \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* THE FIRST GENERATION MOSES BAKER was born ca 1708 , probably in Virginia and he died in 1786 in Edgecombe County , North Carolina .\nHe wife s name was Sarah and on October 24 , 1786 she testified in Court that she had received her share of her deceased husband s estate from Jesse Baker , the executor .\nBD 4 p 559 .\nMoses Baker had formerly lived in Bertie County , North Carolina on Chinquapin Creek sometimes called Chinkapin .\nHis brother , Bennett Baker , lived next door .\nChinquapin Creek was a branch of the Chowan River , which was the dividing line between Bertie and Chowan Counties .\nWhen Hertford County was formed in 1854 , Chinquapin Creek was in that County .\nOther Bakers living in the area were William Baker and his two sons , William Jr. and James ; Benjamin Baker , Henry Baker and Blake Baker .\nBell pp 76 , 155 , 179 , 200 , 216 , 223 .\nMoses sold his land in Bertie County in 1748 and he moved to Edgecombe County , North Carolina .\nSOMETIME BETWEEN 1750 AND 1757 , MOSES BAKER AND HIS SON , MOSES BAKER JR. , SERVED IN THE MILITIA IN THE COMPANY COMMANDED BY CAPTAIN SOLOMON ALSTON .\nCaptain Alston s Company guarded the soother area of Edgecombe County that later was cut off to form the northeast part of Wilson County in 1855 .\nHugh Johnston .\nIn 1777 , Meady Bozeman deeded one acre of land to the Protestant Ana - Baptist Church on Town Creek .\nTown Creek branched off of Swamp Creek , a branch of the Tar River .\nMoses Baker was a member and a trustee of the church .\nOther trustees were Miles Scarbory , John Stokes , William Scarbory and James Scarbory .\nWitnesses to the deed were Malachi Mounts and Jesse Drake .\nDB 3 p 285 , Edge .\nCo. , N. C. I have estimated the birthdates of Moses Baker and his children in this way .\nMichael Baker , the eldest son of Moses Baker , died in 1776 , and he was the father of ten living children .\nTwo of his sons were of legal age when he died , as he appointed them executors of his Will .\nThat means that they were born before 1753-55 .\nSubtract twenty-one years from 1753 and we have the approximate date of Michael s birth , which would be about 1732-34 .\nThomas Baker , the fourth son of Moses Baker , was married January 1 , 1763 , to Penelope Williams .\nIf he was twenty-one years old or older , when he married , then he would have been born about 1740-42 .\nJesse Baker , the youngest son of Moses , was married and the father of four sons when his father died in 1786 .\nHis eldest son was born in 1777 .\nThat would place Jesse Baker s birthdate about 1753-55 .\nMoses Baker 1 had eight children 2 .\nMichael Baker b. ca .\n1732-34 , d. 1776 , Surry County , N.

'Editor s note The Columbus Museum provided source material to Resource Library for the following article .\nIf you have questions or comments regarding the source material , please contact the Columbus Museum directly through either this phone number or web address 706-649-0713 http \\/ \\/ www.columbusmuseum.com Two Columbus Legacies Alma Thomas and Lamar Baker November 13 , 2004 - February 27 , 2005 The Columbus Museum is paying tribute to the artistic achievements of Georgia natives Alma Thomas 1891-1978 and Lamar Baker 1908-1994 in the exhibition Two Columbus Legacies .\nThe exhibit , on view in the Museum s Shorter - Leebern Gallery from November 14 , 2004 to February 27 , 2005 , features approximately 100 prints , drawings and paintings by the two artists that are drawn from the Columbus Museum s extensive holdings .\nThomas vibrant abstractions came to international prominence in 1972 when she became the first African - American woman to be awarded a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art .\nAlthough influenced by earlier modern masters such as Matisse and Picasso , her work was perhaps more shaped by her fascination with the optical effects of pure color and with natural forms-especially flowers .\nBaker achieved national recognition for his socially and politically-charged prints , many of which depict African - American life in the South .\nThe artist s images reflect his keen interest in gospel music as well as folk art and surrealism .\nA special website for this exhibition has been developed .\nThe site , which includes details about the artists , images , family activities and information for educators and students , can be accessed at a computer kiosk in the exhibition .\nAlma Thomas and Lamar Baker were two exceptional artists who experienced firsthand the dramatic changes in the American art world during much of the twentieth century .\nBoth were Southerners who established successful careers in major art centers in the North .\nBoth became involved in art movements of national importance and drew their inspiration from direct observations of contemporary life .\nBoth have ties to Columbus -- the city was Thomas birthplace and the place in which the Atlanta-born Baker spent much of his later life .\nBeyond these few similarities , however , the two artists pursued remarkably different paths .\nAlma Thomas was a woman of color who escaped racial prejudices in the South by moving to Washington , DC , where she eventually became a prominent abstract painter .\nThomas rejected the notion of painting stereotypically black subjects and instead embraced modernism in her quest to develop a universal language of color and form .\nThe primary inspiration for the artist s luminous abstractions was the natural beauty she sought in outdoor settings , especially flower gardens .\nAlthough white , Lamar Baker made regular trips from his studio in New York City to Atlanta , where he depicted with great conviction and detail such topics as political corruption , social injustice , poverty and , above all , the difficult circumstances of African American life in the South -- the same factors that had driven Alma Thomas to leave Columbus as a teenager in 1907 .\nIn fact , influential curator and critic Carl Zigrosser once referred to him as one of the first native artists to reckon with the problems of the new South .\nUnlike Thomas , Baker employed a clear , narrative style , remained highly suspicious of avant garde art movements , and produced his most inspired work early in his career between 1935 and 1945 .\nAlma Thomas , however , was a fiercely modern artist who did not reach her full potential as an artist until age 68 -- after she retired from teaching and devoted her full-time energies to painting .\nright Lamar Baker , Self - Portrait with Cotton Plant , 1940 , lithograph , 11 3\\/4 x 9 inches .\nMuseum purchase Featuring nearly 100 objects , Two Legacies celebrates the Columbus Museum s extensive holdings by Thomas and Baker , and focuses special attention on their works on paper .\nBoth artists considered paper an important and versatile support material for their artistic creations in a variety of media .\nFor Thomas , watercolor and gouache were principal modes of experimentation and she relished the watery washes of translucent color as well as the dense , controlled color shapes that these media afforded .\nBaker created numerous drawings and watercolors , but produced much of his most compelling and inspired work in the form of lithographic prints made by drawing in greasy crayon on a fine grained stone that is moistened with water , rubbed with an oily ink that adheres to the dry waxy marks only , and then run through a press .\nThis exhibition represents the first time the bulk of the Columbus Museum s holdings by the two artists have been shown , and the first time they have been presented together .\nThe Museum is grateful to the late Miss John Maurice Thomas and the family of Alma Thomas for its important gift of what certainly stands as one of the largest collections of Thomas s works on paper .\nIn addition , the Museum acknowledges the generosity of Lamar Baker , who bequeathed the prints , paintings and drawings in what now represents the most extensive body of Baker s work in existence .\nThis exhibit is sponsored by generous funding from the Fifth Generation Foundation .\nOn Saturday , February 12 , from 2 30-4 30 p.m. , visitors may view films about African - American artists , including Alma Thomas A Life in Art .\nThis free program is open to all ages .\nEditor s note RL readers may read more about Lamar Baker in Section 5 of Tales from the Easel Nineteenth -
