Michael Howard s Dissapointment Written by Titus A. Dux Story written 20 December 2004 Email this story Print this story Howard yesterday before sunrise Labor Shadow Home Secretary in-waiting Michael Howard has described his dissapointment in not recieving a mandate from the pricipal deity Tony Blair to become the new home secretary as most unfortunate Michael Howard , 56 , of Transylvania East is distraught that all the support he has given to Tony Blair since joining the Government in 2003 has come to nothing .\nHe said in a recent interview How else could we bring in solid Tory policies if we do not elect a new labor government at the next election .\nHowever his words appear to have fallen upon deaf ears at No 10 Mr Howard-racula also stated that he found it most disturbing that his former employer , Baroness Thatcher , was described as a wishy washy liberal by the new Home Secretary Charlie Clarke and that real strides would be made to pry into peoples private lives without him being in charge of it .\nI Have always been the bastion of the nanny state he said and I have read 1984 more than 20 times so I must know what I m talking about Charles Clarke has since refuted suggestions that he has been appointed as a glove puppet for Mr Blairs totalitarian regime by increasing the emphasis on the most unpopular policies such as ID cards .\nAs long as I have the conservatives vote , I have a mandate he said yesterday at the meeting of the BNP .\nThe problem with British politics is that it s difficult to get your ideas across to the more intelligent MP s at times , so it s best to alter the agenda slightly during the debate stage Michael Howard is still one of the favorites to be invited into the cabinet in the next Labor government having a good track record in the erosion of civil liberties and the promotion of labor policy .\nhe also has a good record in sacking any oppposition members who might compete with Tony Blair in the popularity stakes , and is an ardent supporter of the government in the house of commons .\nSecretary of State for Education and Skills The Rt Hon Ruth Kelly MP has since suggested that the word opposition be removed from the national curriculum and the Oxford English Dictionary Just in case someone ever looks up the meaning !\nwhich we assume means that Michael Howard never has ?\nThe story above is a satire or parody .\nIt is entirely fictitious .\nIf you fancy trying your hand at comedy spoof news writing , click here to join !\nI ve got nothing else to do , what s next ?\nRate this story Send this to someone !\nEmail -LRB- ! -- google_ad_client = pub-9552315955068675 ; google_ad_width = 468 ; google_ad_height = 60 ; google_ad_format = 468x60_as ; google_ad_type = text_image ; google_ad_channel = 8570529823 ; google_color_border = FFFFFF ; google_color_bg = FFFFFF ; google_color_link = CC0000 ; google_color_text = 000000 ; google_color_url = CC0000 ; \\/ \\/ -- -RRB- del. icio . us Digg this Top UK Headlines Stories Illicit New Drug - Better than Crack French onions hit the south coast of England Camilla sex change op spun as hysterectomy Blair I Was Cameron s Pusher , What Of It ?\nSudden unexpected death syndrome hits Gaydar co-founder Frisch Pete Doherty to help David Cameron get clean Cameron hopes to be Britain s first pot-head PM Things Aren t Quite So Bootiful Down Norfolk way -LRB- ! -- google_ad_client = pub-9552315955068675 ; google_ad_width = 160 ; google_ad_height = 600 ; google_ad_format = 160x600_as ; google_ad_type = text_image ; google_ad_channel = 4084711117 ; google_color_border = FFFFFF ; google_color_bg = FFFFFF ; google_color_link = CC0000 ; google_color_text = 000000 ; google_color_url = CC0000 ; \\/ \\/ -- -RRB- Copyright 2003-2007 , The Spoof.com All items on this website are fictitious .\nAny resemblance to persons , living or dead , is entirely coincidental or is intended purely as a satire , parody or spoof .\nPlease see our terms and conditions and disclaimer .\nHome The News Jokes Write For Us Satire Articles About Discuss Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy RSS var dc _ Unit ID = 14 ; var dc _ Publisher ID = 7354 ; var dc _ Ad Link Color = FF0000 ; var dc_open_new_win = yes ; var dc_is Bold Active = no ; var dc_adprod = ADL ;\n\n',068

N. Mohlman Barrington , RI USA - See all my reviews The Franco - Prussian War is an unusual conflict in that it is in many ways a study in contrasts .\nHistorically , it set the stage for two twentieth century conflagrations even as it settled scores from the early nineteenth century .\nPolitically , it marked the zenith of French national influence , and the ascendancy of a united German power .\nFinally , militarily , it offered the first widespread use of breech-loading rifles and modern artillery , even as it often languished in the tactics of an earlier age .\nIt takes a broad brush to capture all of these elements , and in this book , Michael Howard has succeeded admirably .\nHe has taken an often overlooked conflict and placed it squarely at the crossroads of modern Europe , and a new , more terrible type of war .\nFor while the American Civil War or even the Crimean War is often referred to as the first modern war , it is in fact in the Franco - Prussian War that we see all the key elements of modern warfare national mobilization , citizen soldiers under the guidance of a professional general staff , and the ascendancy of industrialization in both transport and new , more destructive , weapons .\nAt the same time , newer , more insidious developments in the form of guerrilla warfare and the targeting of civilians centers for strategic reasons first make their appearance on a large scale .\nArising out of French objections to the Prussian selection of the Spanish monarch , this war , like many before and since , arose out of a complete lack of French appreciation for the changes that had overtaken the battlefield .\nWhile the French had relied on a small , professional army , the Prussians had adopted a model of mandatory service that allowed them to raise massive , reasonably competent forces with unprecedented speed .\nThus , when hostilities broke out the French , who had assumed an easy victory , were caught on their heels and never regained the initiative .\nThus from the summer of 1870 through the depths of winter and into 1871 , the story of the Franco - Prussian War is the story of the courage of the French soldier being failed utterly by inept leadership .\nIt wasn t in the strength of Prussian arms , or in the courage of its soldiers that the war was won ; rather , it was in the ability of the centralized Prussian command structure to adapt rapidly to events when their French counterparts were still in the dark that victory was secured .\nThus , while Howard s writing on the actual combat is vivid , it is in his appreciation of the fundamentally new Prussian way of war that he is most successful .\nFrom the king , through the Bismarck and Moltke , and on down through the rest of the senior command , he paints a vivid portrait of Prussian ideals and ambition .\nConversely , he is equally successful at capturing the decrepitude and ineptness of a fragmented French government that lost the war in its opening days , and then prolonged it , to the never ending suffering of its soldiers , long after all hope was lost .\nLikewise along these lines , Howard nicely illustrates the increasing conflict that inevitable comes between politicians and the military in an era of total war .\nThat said , I do have a few minor complaints .\nThe first is that Howard almost never translates quotes from the original French or German , and while I was just barely able to muddle through with what I remember from high school and college , any one who hasn t been exposed to these languages would certainly be frustrated .\nSecondly , as anyone familiar with European politics knows , nothing happens in a vacuum , and yet Howard spends precious little time discussing the implications of the conflict within the international system of the time .\nFinally , while Howard offers many maps , they offer little to know information about troop positions and lines of march , which leaves the reader flipping back rather than digesting a detailed map at a glance .\nHowever , these are minor complaints about an otherwise eminently successful work .\nHoward has packed a tremendous amount of research into a readable and digestible volume .\nHis appreciation of the politics and personalities is matched only by his understanding of the weapons of war and the nature of combat .\nNot only is this a successful history of the Franco - Prussian war , but also a model of what good history writing should be balanced , well researched , and above all , readable .\nFinally , Howard s success elevates the Franco - Prussian War to its rightful significance as one of the root causes of the tensions that led to WWI , and hence , to WWII .\nThus the student of history should appreciate this work not just for its success in considering immediate events , but for providing a bridge from the Great Power politics of the nineteenth century to the wars of the twentieth .\nJake Mohlman Comment | Was this review helpful to you ?\n16 of 16 people found the following review helpful The French Military Debacle of 1870 , January 29 , 2003 Reviewer Timothy J. Graczewski tgraczewski Burlingame , CA United States - See all my reviews It seems in retrospect as though fate had decided that there should be no humiliation which the French army should be spared .\nThat one sentence accurately captures the tenor of Michael Howard s masterful history of the Franco - Prussian War .\nFirst published in 1961-and representing Howard s debut as a military historian - his history of the stunning Prussian victory over the heavily favored French has stood the test of time and rightfully confirmed his place as one of the preeminent historians of war in the twentieth century .\nHoward tells the story of the war primarily from the French perspective , and it is a stinging indictment of that country s political and military system at that time .\nDisgraced French commanders such as Bazaine or Bourbaki are more pitied by Howard than criticized for their performance .\nHe argues that primary fault for the disasters that befell the French armies were more the product of a defective French military system that put such incompetent men in command of large armies , rather than the fault of the incompetent commanders themselves .\nOnly occasionally does Howard divert his attention to the Prussian side , and when he does it is most often to discuss the friction generated between Moltke and Bismark or to describe the usually quick and effective Prussian reaction to halting or diffident French moves .\nHowever , Howard seems to place no stock in the notion of a German genius for war .\nFor instance , he is quick to point out the many mistakes Moltke s army made , particularly in the early days of the conflict , and notes that more often than not the French troops gave just as good as they got in open battles with the Germans .\nIn many ways , the Franco - Prussian War marked the culmination of the dramatic military reforms begun by Scharnhorst after the disastrous defeat at the hands of Napoleon at the Battle of Jena in 1806 .\nPrussian improvements in military recruitment , training and organization , and most notably the development of a General Staff responsible for managing the immense requirements of modern war were all brought to bear on the French and in many accounts is credited with the stunning victory .\nHoward recognizes the revolutionary implications of the railroad , telegraph and rifled weaponry , and also notes the decisive influence Prussian military planning and organization had in the conflict .\nIndeed , he notes that the war was a watershed event in military history .\nOn the one hand , the conflict included perhaps the last successful cavalry charge in history , as well as the final employment of Vauban s time-honored siegecraft techniques developed in the 17th century .\nYet , the war also held some harbingers of future warfare , such as the deliberate bombardment of civilian populations at Strasburg and Paris in an attempt to undermine civilian morale and storm troop tactics developed to minimize casualties in attacking positions defended by troops with rapid firing rifled weaponry .\nNevertheless , in the final analysis , Howard seems to credit the French more with defeat than the Prussians with victory .\nFinally , it should be noted there are a lack of adequate campaigns maps , which makes many portions of the book difficult to follow .\nComment | Was this review helpful to you ?\nCustomer Reviews Average Customer Review Write an online review and share your thoughts with other customers .\n0 of 2 people found the following review helpful Dry as Dust , September 14 , 2006 Reviewer G. Quinn Atlantic City , NJ USA - See all my reviews I don t know enough about the Franco - Prussian War to criticize the research and the facts presented .\nBut this is certainly not an enjoyable book to read .\nIf that is a factor for you , be warned .\nComment | Was this review helpful to you ?\n2 of 6 people found the following review helpful Boring but informative , May 20 , 2004 Reviewer George Dimitriou georgestuff2000 mays landing , nj United States - See all my reviews I actually have not finished the book yet , so forgive my hypocrisy .\nFrom an information and accuracy perspective it is probably the best book on the war .\nHowever it is a bit of a tough read , so be prepared .\nHoward details technology and warfare of the time , along with politics and the like and the book doesn t miss much .\nHowever , perhaps that is the reason it seems so long .\noverall I would say a good book .\nComment | Was this review helpful to you ?\n2 of 3 people found the following review helpful an authoritative treatment of a complex conflict , September 28 , 2003 Reviewer doc peterson Portland , Oregon USA - See all my reviews Howard does a masterful job in detailing the the military preparations of both sides before the conflict , describing the war itself , and even going into some detail about the increasing importance of technology in modern warfare especially transport .\nHowever , there are some shortcommings - the chief among them are the maps .\nWhile they are useful in giving the reader an idea of what happened where , they really needed to be more detailed , showing troop movements and positions .\nI also thought the lack of perspective on the war was disappointing - after all , the Franco - Prussian war was instrumental in the creation of German nationhood , the birth of the Fourth republic , and a foundation stone of the First World War .\nNone of these important after-effects were discussed in any detail whatsoever .\nAs a book of pure military history , though , Howard s book is beyond reproach .\nComment | Was this review helpful to you ?\n7 of 7 people found the following review helpful Brisk and Detailed , April 24 , 2003 Reviewer michael643 Mc Kinney , TX United States - See all my reviews This is a very detailed account of the military and - to a lesser extent - political maneuverings of the Franco - Prussian War .\nGiven the detail and the heavy footnoting , it is a surprisingly brisk read , though I do have one suggestion to assist future readers photocopy the various pages that have maps on them so you can easily refer to them as you read on .\nSince I hadn t thought of this idea while reading the book , I found myself holding two or even three such pages open with the fingers of my left hand while reading battle descriptions many , many pages later .\nOne disappointment was in the very brief epilogue .\nThe author discusses how the speed of the Prussian victory raised the stakes for all European powers , Germany in particular , but the author does not really discuss the aftermath of the war in France or explain how France formed a post-war government given the fractious way it had fought the war .\nEvery history needs to stop at some point , of course , but a brief explanation of France s recovery seems in order .\nComment | Was this review helpful to you ?\nSee all 12 customer reviews ...\nCustomer Discussions Beta What s this ?\nNew !\nReceive e-mail when new posts are made .\nClick the Track it !\nbutton on any discussion page .\nThis product s forum 0 discussions Ask questions , Share opinions , Gain insight Start a new discussion Topic First post Receive e-mail when new posts are made Prompts for sign-in Guidelines Product Information from the Amapedia Community Beta What s this ?\nBe the first person to add an article about this item at Amapedia.com .\nSee featured Amapedia.com articles Search Listmania !\nListmania !\nGerman History A list by Jeffrey C.

I just got here , and I have a talk tomorrow morning @ 9 AM about Windows Vista Security Engineering .\nNow to the topic of this post .\nOne of my favorite features in Windows Vista is Parental Controls .\nI like the feature because my 5 year old son , Blake , loves to use the computer but I really don t want him using the computer too much , because he gets that glazed-over-eyes look .\nYou know the look !\nSo I limit his use to between 4 PM and 7 PM during the week , which basically means he can t use it before school .\nThe other day a Saturday he wanted to use the computer , and my wife had asked me to lock him out because he d hit his sister , or something .\nSo I tweaked the Parental Controls policy to block out Saturday .\nHe came to me asking if he could use the computer because he couldn t logon .\nI said , No , because he d hit his kid sister , or something .\nI went to go about my own business , and came back fifteen minutes later to see that Blake had opened the computer case and , with screwdriver in hand , was trying to fix things , daddy so he could access the computer !\nI didn t know whether to laugh , cry or be proud that my son wasn t going to be held back by some stinkin software policy !\n- Posted Wednesday , February 07 , 2007 6 17 PM by michael _ HOWARD | 11 Comments Filed under Vista , Security What is it that makes security hard ?\nI ve been asked this question numerous times , often in the guise of a question like , why can t you guys simply fix the security problem ?\nor reliability and scalability problems are understood and solvable , why can t you do the same with security ?\nor my favorite variant , what the heck keeps you interested in security when it seems you re fighting a no-win battle ?\nFirst , there is little agreement around what constitutes a security bug so I ll leave that subject for another day !\nNext , I m no expert on the science behind reliability or scalability , so I ll take it at face value that when people say these issues are understood and solvable and they are being honest .\nSo what is it that makes security hard ?\nIt s simple Scalability and reliability issues are man-vs-machine and machines are stupid .\nSecurity is man-vs-man and humans are intelligent .\nThis security stuff is an ongoing arms race and chess game , and each side is constantly trying to outwit the other .\nWe raise the bar , and the attackers then spend time trying to defeat that bar .\nSo we raise the bar again , and so on .\nWith reliability and scalability , we can understand the adversary and that s that .\nThe enemy won t adapt to defeat you !\nTo be honest , it s this on-going intellectual battle that keeps me coming back to security , but it also means that no-one will ever build 100 \% secure computer products and this why we update the Security Development Lifecycle SDL twice a year as we learn new attack and defense techniques .\nPosted Friday , February 02 , 2007 4 20 PM by michael _ HOWARD | 4 Comments Filed under Rant , Security Security Features vs.\nConvenience Jim Allchin has a great blog post about some of the design issues we went through and tradeoffs we made in Windows Vista around DEP , UAC , IE and so on .\nIt s a long , but worthwhile read .\nPosted Wednesday , January 24 , 2007 10 17 AM by michael _ HOWARD | 0 Comments Filed under Vista , Security A couple of interesting security blog posts Jeff has an uncanny ability to dig into details that most folks gloss over Exposed ?\nExamining Secunia Unpatched Warnings -

One more thing , the VS team has provided a list of known issues with VS on Windows Vista .\nPosted Thursday , January 04 , 2007 2 51 PM by michael _ HOWARD | 11 Comments Filed under Rant , Vista , Security Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 Update for Windows Vista Beta Available From the blurb During the development of Windows Vista , several key investments were made to vastly improve overall quality , security , and reliability from previous versions of Windows .\nWhile we have made tremendous investments in Windows Vista to ensure backwards compatibility , some of the system enhancements , such as User Account Control , changes to the networking stack , and the new graphics model , make Windows Vista behave differently from previous versions of Windows .\nThese investments impact Visual Studio 2005 .\nThe Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 Update for Windows Vista Beta addresses areas of Visual Studio impacted by Vista enhancements .\nMany of the Windows Vista enhancements are documented at the Windows Vista Development Center .\nThe update is here .\nPosted Monday , January 01 , 2007 8 51 PM by michael _ HOWARD | 7 Comments Filed under Vista , Security e XPired Poster Available !\nFirst , a very Happy New Year to you all ... !\nSecond , due to incredibly popular demand , I managed to find the e XPired poster .\nI have added it as an attachment at the end of this blog post .\nEnjoy .\nPosted Monday , January 01 , 2007 5 54 PM by michael _ HOWARD | 14 Comments Filed under Vista Online Security Sessions from Tech Ed IT Forum Available Knowing the Enemy -

Kathleen Pratt Planting the seeds of wonder is not an easy task where asphalt is much more common than grass and the buzz of cars whizzing by on the highway is a constant sound .\nBut Michael and Amelia Howard live in more than one habitat , and they ve found that the children of their community want to do so too .\nMichael enjoys leading groups from his church and the community on excursions to destinations such as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northern Minnesota .\nBut the Howards don t just look far away for the peace and thrill they experience in nature .\nFuller Park backs up to the Dan Ryan Expressway and is bordered on the west by train tracks .\nThe Howards an enthusiastic pair whose deliberate actions and manner of speaking provide a glimpse of their dedicated nature can sense a trace of wilderness even here .\nWe have to breathe the same air as everyone else , says Michael , an avid outdoorsman for years .\nThe Howards are respected leaders in the Mighty Acorns .\nConceived as an introduction to the local environment through schools science curriculums and developed jointly by the Forest Preserve District of Cook County and The Nature Conservancy , the Mighty Acorns program trains volunteer leaders to bring school-aged children into local parks and forest preserves as stewards .\nThere , adults and children together plant native species , clear invasive brush , gather seeds , investigate animal tracks , look and listen for birds and insects and learn first-hand about our native ecosystems and local preserves .\nKids are taught to be stewards of the forest , says Michael .\nWith an easy-going , natural diplomacy , he works devotedly to bring understanding of wilderness into all aspects of his life , including his family , his church and his job as executive director of the not-for-profit Fuller Park Community Development agency .\nWhen Hendricks Academy , the elementary school where Amelia works as a pre-kindergarten teacher s aide , became the first urban school to participate in the Mighty Acorns program during the spring of 1993 , the Howards spearheaded the effort .\nToday , Hendricks Academy , located just down the block from the Howards Chicago home , serves as a model for 30 schools in the Chicago area .\nHendricks partnered with Hubbard Woods Elementary in Winnetka to engage in joint projects and field trips .\nThe idea , Michael says , was to bring students of different backgrounds and races together for a common cause .\nRaising awareness about environmental issues and enabling children to recognize the resources in their own backyard is a main focus of the program , Michael says .\nIt also provides children who participate with a unique sense of ownership .\nHaving a stake in healthy nature , Amelia says , is something both she and her husband grew up with .\nEverybody s family had a garden then , she says .\nNow , fishing , camping and canoeing are a way of life for the Howards , who have raised all five of their children , ranging in ages eight to twenty-four , to appreciate the land and to build their own connection with nature .\nYou can appreciate what s right here in the city , Michael says .\nIn fact , he is investigating the possibility of creating a small preserve right in his own neighborhood .\nNot far from the Howards front doorstep , a vacant lot has served as little more than a dump for almost 30 years .\nWouldn t this be an ideal site for a small-scale restoration ?\nthey ask .\nOld oaks at one end of the lot are remnant vestiges of an oak woodland ; in the center , the Howards envision a small prairie and a re-created wetland .\nMichael even imagines experimental aquaculture and fish farming .\nThese could be both educational tools and economic ventures , he explains .\nNeighborhood residents could be trained to work and school children could come as well , revitalizing the community in the process , he says .\nMichael and Amelia compare this lot to the restoration planned for Washington Park , also on Chicago s South Side .\nThat undertaking still in the planning phases , but moving ahead quickly now that it has received backing from the city will provide a beautiful and easily accessible natural area to urban residents .\nIncreased access to natural areas brings communities together and piques interest in a sense of wonder and respect for life .\nFrom there , the Howards explain , personal and community growth come naturally .\nWhat is Chicago Wilderness ?\n| Store | Donations | Contact Us | Home Copyright 2006 Chicago Wilderness Magazine , Inc. .

having a blast .\nWhen Michael saw the magazine article he had an artist take the image and incorporate the harlequin figure ; symbolizing theatrical tradition .\nSo , more briefly put , the logo represents geniuses at play .\nA Method of One s Own Reprinted by permission from the January 1995 issue of American Theatre Magazine published by TCG MICHAEL HOWARD Founder \\/ Director .\nMichael Howard Studios , New York I taught at Juilliard in the drama division for eight years .\nDuring that period I continued my private class , working with actors who had begun their professional careers .\nClearly the intensive training at Juilliard had great value for all the participants at whatever level .\nBut there were also drawbacks to conservatory training .\nUnderstandably , the actor is not allowed to accept professional engagements ; a difficult restriction for some , an impossible restriction for others .\nFurther , training institutions admit people into the first year when perhaps the individual should have second-year work , or perhaps at the end of six months the are really ready to move into the second or third year .\nObviously , none of this is possible .\nThen there is the problem of chemistry ; that very important relationship between student and teachers .\nIt is not just a question of what is being taught but how .\nAll teachers have seen that look on the face of a student which says , Oh , god , do I have to spend a year with this person ?\nIt s like an arranged marriage , it s daunting .\nIn this studio students sign up for one month at a time .\nIt s hard to maintain this organizationally , even financially , but everyone in my class is in the seat because that s where he or she wants to be .\nI think that s important .\nAlso these people have limited study time and money .\nIt s possible for me to say , Listen , stop my class , concentrate on your voice work and then come back .\nActors construct their own university program .\nThe vast majority of actors who study at this studio have a goodly amount of previous training .\nAnd the teachers who teach here come from very different backgrounds .\nI think we would all agree that our job is to help them define their own method .\nYoung actors today ask me , Do you do Meisner ?\nor Do you do Strasberg ?\nIt s all rather faddish .\nWhen I m asked , What is Michael Howard s method ?\nI run .\nI say , I don t have a method of acting .\nI suppose I have a method of training .\nI think it s a bit slick but I think it s true .\nI work with actors individually to develop their own method .\nIn any important performance , the actor is in danger , the actor is at risk .\nAn actor illuminates the material , reveals the playwright by revealing some aspect of him or herself ; often something private .\nIn our theater , there s a great deal of talk about use yourself , or just be there .\nIn fact , that s very important .\nIt is the bottom line .\nBut it raises the essential question , Which self ?\nThe whole rehearsal process is based on discovering which self the playwright wants you to bring to the work .\nI tell the actors the world needs us desperately , whether the world recognizes it or not .\nI demand that they prepare themselves to be the best actors they can be .\nA life in the American theater means to do and do well commercials , a great play which no one sees , a soap for a few years , a lousy movie that everyone sees , a great part in a movie that leads to nothing .\nI think it s a splendid way to spend a life .\nIf you re lucky , if you hang on long enough , and if you ready yourself as an artist , you will get work .\nThere s struggle and pain , but I think making a life in the theater is worth it .\nActing is easy - it s not a desperately complicated process .\nSome children have done it startlingly well , brilliantly well , in ways that make you gulp .\nThe hard part is becoming an artist - which means using all of you , not just the comfortable part , not just the part the child uses easily and quickly , not just the part they buy and want again and again .\nIt is when you begin to use the dreadful parts , the secret parts , as well as the hero parts that the word artist begins to have a very special meaning .\nAnd that takes time .\nIt can happen without any help from anybody , it can not happen without work .\nIt happens more efficiently with study .\nThere are actors - Dustin Hoffman is one - working in the commercial theater who insist that the industry let them stretch , who insist that they use the clown part of them or the woman part of them .\nThey force themselves to go out and find those parts .\nAnd they become artists .\nThose who keep repeating , don t. The actors who aren t getting that kind of opportunity in the business and need a place to extend their work are the ones I can help .\nNot teach them how to act , but to help them develop , grow , extend .\nSelf - Marketing COMING SOON !!\nCopyright Michael Howard Studios 2004\nMichael Howard Studios\n',007

S. President George W. Bush emerged as the Labor Party s gravest points of political vulnerability .\nAnd so , through 2003 and 2004 , Michael Howard step by step altered his once strong and clear views on Iraq .\nIn hopes of getting to 10 Downing Street , he used carefully coded language to try to reach out to war opponents -- without formally abandoning his still theoretically pro-war position , finally arriving at a position on the war so elaborately double-embossed , so intricately reverse-chased , that it defied human understanding .\nIn a July , 2004 , debate in the House of Commons , Howard declared 1 that if he had it to do all over again , he would not have voted in favor of the October , 2002 , war motion , but that 2 he still supported the war nonetheless .\nAt various points over the past 18 months , he has accused Blair of dereliction of duty , has demanded he resign and finally called him a liar outright .\nAt the same time , Howard has said that he had many areas of agreement with the Prime Minister and has endorsed most of Blair s present policies .\nWhen asked point-blank what he would do in Iraq today , Howard has simply changed the subject , announcing that it is time to move on from the Iraq debate .\nMany people have compared Howard s difficulties with Iraq to those of John Kerry .\nBut there is a big difference .\nOver nearly two decades , Kerry had established a record as one of the most dovish members of the U. S. Senate .\nHe opposed the Reagan defense buildup of the 1980s , opposed the struggle against communism in Central America , and opposed the first Gulf War .\nWhen Kerry voted in favor of America s war resolution in October , 2002 , few doubted that he was engaged in an act of political opportunism that he truly wanted to vote no , but that he was afraid that a no might cost him the presidency -- as indeed his vote against the Gulf War had probably cost him a place as Bill Clinton s running mate in 1992 .\nAs Kerry moved to a more and more anti-war position in 2004 , he was moving closer and closer to his true self .\nHoward , by contrast , is an instinctive hawk .\nHis October , 2002 , vote reflected his genuine views -- his move toward a more anti-war position has been a move away from his true self .\nIt s hard to say which act of opportunism is morally worse , Howard s or Kerry s. Politically , though , I fear it is Howard s that will prove more damaging to his party .\nKerry did the Democrats one great service By attacking Bush on the war and losing so badly , he discredited Vietnam-era anti-war politics probably for good .\nSince November , every would-be president in the Democratic ranks has steered sharply to the right on national security -- and if the Democrats win in 2008 , Kerry s negative example will deserve much of the credit .\nHoward also will almost certainly lose .\nBut what message will Conservatives take away from the experience ?\nI very much fear that they will put the blame for their defeat not on Howard s maladroit opportunism but on his inner core of conviction .\nI fear that next time they will go looking for a man who is all opportunism -- and given the state of today s Conservative Party , they will have a wide range of choice .\nHoward , tragically , arrived at the right answer only at the very end British voters in fact have moved on from the Iraq debate .\nThey were never going to vote out Tony Blair if they did not trust the Conservatives on health , education and the economy .\nAnd if the Conservatives could have regained that trust , no opportunism on Iraq would have been needed in the first place .\nDavid Frum is a resident fellow at AEI .\nRelated Links A Dialogue on the UK Election AEI Print Index No. .\n18364 Also by David Frum Recent Articles Free Speech in Name Only The Politics of Bulls and Bears That s What We Get for Trusting Syria Latest Book An End to Evil How to Win the War on Terror Latin American Outlook In the latest edition of Latin American Outlook , Roger F.

Safely as an Administrator Michael Howard Microsoft Security Engineering November 15 , 2004 Summary Michael Howard discusses how you can run as an administrator and access Internet data safely by dropping unnecessary administrative privileges when using any tool to access the Internet .\n10 printed pages Download the Drop My Rights . msi file .\nI ve said this many times , but I ll say it again , Running with an administrative account is dangerous to the health of your computer and your data .\nSo , whenever someone says they must operate their computers as administrators , I always try to persuade them it s not the correct thing to do from a security perspective .\nThat said , every once in a while I meet someone who has a valid reason .\nFor example , I use one of the computers in my office to install the latest daily build of Windows , and I need to be an administrator to install the OS .\nHowever , and this is a big point , I do not read e-mail , browse the Web , or access the Internet in any form when running as an administrator on that machine .\nAnd I do not do so because the Web is the source of most of the nasty attacks today .\nWhat if someone does want to browse the Web ?\nOr read e-mail ?\nOr do Instant Messaging and so on , and for some reason must run in an administrative context ?\nIf you look at the major threats to computers , they are from user interaction with the Web through tools like browsers and e-mail clients .\nSure , there are non-user interaction attacks , such as Blaster http \\/ \\/ www.cert.org\\/advisories\\/ CA-2003-20 . html and Lion http \\/ \\/ www.sans.org\\/y2k\\/lion.htm , but that s in part why we turned on the firewall in Windows XP SP2 !\nNote For Best practices on running as a non-admin , I urge you to look over Aaron Margosis blog to glean tips on running as a non-admin in Windows .\nAn Example of Why Running as an Admin Is Bad Some nasty malware works only because the user browsing the Web is an administrator .\nA good example is a recent variation of the Bagle \\/ Beagle worm named W32 .\nBeagle .\nAV@mm .\nI would recommend you read up on what the worm does once it is invited onto a computer system .\nSymantec has a good write-up at http \\/ \\/ securityresponse.symantec.com\\/avcenter\\/venc\\/data\\/w32.beagle.av@mm.html .\nI say invited because the malware is not taking advantage of a coding or design defect .\nIt is using simple human error to execute .\nAmongst the many things this malware does , all of which require admin rights , are Creating files in the system32 directory .\nTerminating various processes .\nDisabling the Windows Firewall .\nDownloading and writing files to the system32 directory .\nDeletes registry values in HKLM .\nAll these fail if the user running the e-mail client is not an administrator .\nSo wouldn t it be useful read safer if you could browse the Web , read e-mail , and so on as a non-admin , even though you need to perform your normal daily tasks as an admin ?\nLuckily , Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 and later support this capability using restricted tokens .\nFurther Detail Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 and later support functionality called Software Restriction Policy , also known as SAFER , which allows a user or software developer to run code at a lower privilege without having the user enter credential information when the application starts .\nFor example , an administrator could run an application as a normal user by stripping out certain SIDs and privileges from the application s token as the application is launched .\nSome applications , most notably Internet-facing applications , such as a Web browser , instant messaging , or e-mail client , should never be run under an administrative context .\nThe Drop My Rights Application Drop My Rights is a very simple application to help users who must run as an administrator run applications in a much-safer context that of a non-administrator .\nIt does this by taking the current user s token , removing various privileges and SIDs from the token , and then using that token to start another process , such as Internet Explorer or Outlook .\nThis tool works just as well with Mozilla s Firefox , Eudora , or Lotus Notes e-mail .\nThe code couldn t be simpler .\nHere s the core code \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/ \\/

executable are available at the top of this article .\nNow let s look at configuring the application to run applications in lower privilege .\nSetup Simply copy Drop My Rights . exe to a folder .\nThen for each application you want to run in lower privilege , follow the steps in the next three sections .\nCreate a Shortcut Create a shortcut and enter Drop My Rights . exe as the target executable , followed by the path to the application you want to execute in lower privilege .\nFor example C \\ warez \\ dropmyrights . exe c \\ program files \\ internet explorer \\ iexplore . exe Figure 1 shows what this will look like on your screen .\nFigure 1 .\nPath to application that you want to run in lower privilege Updating the Shortcut Name Next , update the name of the shortcut to represent the executable target , and not dropmyrights .\nI usually put the word Safer after the application name to denote this application will run in a safer security context .\nNon-admin is another common addition , as shown in Figure 2 .\nFigure 2 .\nUpdating the shortcut name Setting the Icon and Run Mode Finally , once the shortcut is created , set the Run option for the shortcut to Minimized and if you want , select a new icon .\nFigure 3 .\nSetting the Run option to Minimized and optionally changing the icon Advanced Options The arguments to Drop My Rights are Drop My Rights path N | C | U The meanings of the variables are Path is the full path of the application to launch .\nN means run the application as a normal user .\nThis is the default if you provide no argument .\nC means run the application as a constrained user .\nU means run the application as an untrusted user .\nChances are , this will cause some applications to fail .\nThe best way to identify what each of these settings does is to look at the resulting process token .\nThe following tables show the changes made to the process token .\nTable 1 .\nAdministrative Account SIDS Restricting SIDS Privileges DOMAIN \\ Domain Users Everyone BUILTIN \\ Administrators BUILTIN \\ Users NT AUTHORITY \\ INTERACTIVE NT AUTHORITY \\ Authenticated Users \\ LOCAL None Se Change Notify Privilege Se Security Privilege Se Backup Privilege Se Restore Privilege Se Systemtime Privilege Se Shutdown Privilege Se Remote Shutdown Privilege Se Take Ownership Privilege Se Debug Privilege Se System Environment Privilege Se System Profile Privilege Se Profile Single Process Privilege Se Increase Base Priority Privilege Se Load Driver Privilege Se Create Pagefile Privilege Se Increase Quota Privilege Se Undock Privilege Se Manage Volume Privilege Se Create Global Privilege Se Impersonate Privilege Table 2 .\nNormal User N SIDS Restricting SIDS Privileges DOMAIN \\ Domain Users Everyone BUILTIN \\ Administrators BUILTIN \\ Users NT AUTHORITY \\ INTERACTIVE NT AUTHORITY \\ Authenticated Users LOCAL None Se Change Notify Privilege Table 3 .\nConstrained C SIDS Restricting SIDS Privileges DOMAIN \\ Domain Users Everyone BUILTIN \\ Administrators BUILTIN \\ Users NT AUTHORITY \\ INTERACTIVE NT AUTHORITY \\ Authenticated Users LOCAL DOMAIN \\ Domain Users Everyone BUILTIN \\ Users NT AUTHORITY \\ INTERACTIVE NT AUTHORITY \\ Authenticated Users LOCAL NT AUTHORITY \\ RESTRICTED Se Change Notify Privilege Table 4 .\nUntrusted U SIDS Restricting SIDS Privileges DOMAIN \\ Domain Users Everyone BUILTIN \\ Administrators BUILTIN \\ Users NT AUTHORITY \\ INTERACTIVE NT AUTHORITY \\ Authenticated Users LOCAL NT AUTHORITY \\ RESTRICTED Everyone NT AUTHORITY \\ INTERACTIVE NT AUTHORITY \\ Authenticated Users BUILTIN \\ Users Se Change Notify Privilege The red cross mark means the SID is still in the token , but it is a deny SID .\nA SID with this attribute is a deny-only SID .\nWhen the system performs an access check , it checks for access-denied ACEs that apply to the SID , but it ignores access-allowed ACEs for the SID .\nThe biggest privilege and SIDs delta is between the administrative account and the normal user account .\nAs you can see , all privileges are stripped from the token except the Bypass Traverse Checking privilege also know as Se Change Notify Privilege .\nConstrained and untrusted are smaller deltas from normal user , and you may start to see some applications fail with security restriction errors .\nMy opinion is use Normal the default for most things , and Constrained if you think you ll be browsing hostile or potentially dangerous Web sites .\nSpot the Security Defect A good number of people worked out the bug in my last article .\nThe Create File function is opening the file for all access , when the code only reads from the file .\nFILE _ ALL _ ACCESS should be replaced with GENERIC _ READ or similar .\nThis is bad because in all likelihood only an administrator can use this code , not a normal user .\nI see this error often .\nCan you spot this code flaw ?\nThis came across my desk the other day as a bug in some Java DNS stuff .\nIt s an interesting bug , which I rewrote in C # and generalized the flaw .\nInt16 req ; ... while true get Request ; req + + ; arr req = Date Time .\nNow ; Michael Howard is a

Ask Aristotle about Michael Howard Andrew Roth Friday March 16 , 2001 Guardian Unlimited Michael Howard , the former Tory home secretary , is one of those half-ghosts from Tory cabinets who materialise on the backbenches to indicate that they are not quite dead to do a spot of Labour-bashing .\nIn his case one can almost see the dagger in his back , inscribed something of the night .\nPiquantly , Ann Widdecombe , his former junior who thus maligned him , has surged into popularity as the more rightwing alternative to Michael Portillo and potential successor to William Hague .\nArticle continues -LRB- a href = http \\/ \\/ ads . guardian . co. uk\\/click . ng \\/ Params . richmedia = yes spacedesc = mpu site = Politics navsection = 3362 section = 108016 country = esp rand = 5203044 -RRB- -LRB- img src = http \\/ \\/ ads . guardian . co. uk\\/image . ng \\/ Params . richmedia = yes spacedesc = mpu site = Politics navsection = 3362 section = 108016 country = esp rand = 5203044 width = 300 height = 250 border = 0 alt = Advertisement -RRB- -LRB- \\/ a -RRB- Mr Howard was the last of the Tory Cambridge Mafia of the 60s - which included Kenneth Clarke , John Gummer , Norman Fowler and Leon Brittan - to retire to the back benches .\nHe came up via Llanelli grammar school in Gorseinon , near Swansea , where his Romanian Jewish shopkeeper father had settled .\nAt school he was one of only two Jewish pupils .\nThe family name of Hecht was anglicised to Howard .\nIn 1966 and 1970 he contested two parliamentary elections for the Conservative party at Edge Hill , Liverpool , before finding a safe seat 13 years later in Folkestone and Hythe .\nThe delay was partly because of his desire to make his way as a successful barrister in planning and employment law , but also provided a chance to cement his marriage to ex-model Saundra Paul - her fourth , his first .\nOnce in the Commons , Mr Howard established his rightwing views .\nIn his maiden speech he urged legal protection for strike breakers , and endorsed the restoration of the death penalty and US intervention in Grenada .\nWithin two years he had begun his climb up the greasy pole of politics .\nA populist home secretary , from 1993 to John Major s 1997 election defeat , he fought crime by locking people up - to the dismay of top judges and his more centrist predecessors like Douglas Hurd .\nHis tough line saw crime drop by 15 \% and made him the darling of the tabloids but he was seriously undermined by his handling of the resignation of the Derek Lewis , the director of prisons , in 1996 .\nMr Lewis fell on his sword when a report into the escape of prisoners from Whitemoor prison highlighted serious deficiencies in the system .\nMr Howard almost suffered the same fate when he was asked about whether he had made Mr Lewis a scapegoat 14 times by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight .\nDespite this public relations disaster , Mr Howard managed to maintain widespread support in the press due to his Europhobia .\nAs the senior Eurosceptic in John Major s cabinet he pursued many battles with Europhile Ken Clarke and seemed well placed to succeed Mr Major .\nThis hope was destroyed in the first round of the Tory leadership battle following their May 1997 defeat .\nAfter William Hague reneged on a deal to run as Mr Howard s deputy , Mr Howard came fifth with 23 votes .\nHe then backed the much younger man and was rewarded with the post of shadow foreign secretary .\nHe spent the next two years doing little else other than demanding Robin Cook s resignation .\nAlthough still very pro- American and against a federal Europe , Mr Howard no longer fitted in with Hague s Little England Europhobes , who criticised him for supporting Nato s attack on Serbia as a just war .\nAfter Mr Hague announced plans for kitchen table Conservatism in March 1999 , Mr Howard retired from frontbench politics to the relative comfort of his well-cushioned boardrooms .\nThere he can exhibit his QC s mind , expressed with a slight Welsh accent in his smoothly courteous personal manner .\nThe departure of Derek Lewis made an enemy of Ann Widdecombe and probably ended Mr Howard s chances of becoming leader .\nHe must often think what might have been if those convicts had not gone over the wall in Whitemoor .\nAsk Aristotle about Michael Howard Privacy policy | Terms conditions | Advertising guide | A -

K. Prime Minister Is Long Shot , New Bio Says April 27 Bloomberg -- With the campaign for U. K. prime minister in full swing , the title of Michael Crick s new biography , `` In Search of Michael Howard , Simon Schuster , 20 pounds , 514 pages seems slightly unfortunate .\nRight now , going in search of Howard is like going in search of your big toe You just look down and there it is .\nHoward is dominating television screen and newspapers in a highly personalized pitch for votes as the May 5 election approaches .\nFew people in Britain would be surprised to find him knocking on the door personally , possibly offering to help out with a few chores around the house .\nThat s about the only unfortunate thing about this book .\nThe 63-year-old Howard could -- just conceivably -- become prime minister , yet he remains a strangely unknown figure .\nCrick has delivered the most comprehensive guide to the man yet published .\nAt the end of its 500 pages , Howard emerges as a more likeable and substantial figure than most people would imagine .\nCrick is an able and experienced biographer , whose past subjects include another Welsh Conservative politician , Michael Heseltine , and the Manchester United soccer manager , Sir Alex Ferguson .\nHis publishers have promoted him as a kind of biographical butcher .\n`` The five most feared words in the election lexicography ` Michael Crick is in reception says the blurb on the back jacket .\nNo Cooperation In keeping with that reputation , Crick remarks in his introduction that he prefers not to have the cooperation of his biographical subjects .\nWhile Howard didn t help with the biography , he also didn t try to stop it .\nCrick conducted numerous interviews with Howard s friends and family for the book .\nHoward s family was part of the wave of Eastern European Jews who moved to Britain in the 1930s .\nThe fact he could rise so far is a mark of how socially mobile postwar Britain had become .\nHis father , Bernat Hecht , who later changed his name to Howard , was born in the rural Romanian district of Ruscova .\n`` Visit Ruscova today and you get vivid glimpses of what agrarian life was like in Europe for most of the last thousand years , writes Crick .\n`` The village economy is still largely self-sufficient much of what people eat and wear is produced locally .\nWithout piped water , citizens still draw supplies from wells , and for most homes the lavatory is a wooden hut over a hole in the backyard .\nMany peasants wear much the same clothes and perform the same daily tasks as their forebears in medieval times .\nPresident of Romania If his father had stayed put , instead of moving to South Wales and opening a clothing shop , Howard might be running for president of Romania .\nHis brand of right-wing , tax-cutting policies might go down better there than they do in Britain Romania has just introduced a flat tax .\nHoward went to the local grammar school , then Cambridge University .\nEven before attending university , he was a Conservative .\n`` To declare oneself a Conservative was a brave act in a town where Labor took two thirds of the vote in the 1955 election won nationally by the Tories , and where almost one in ten of the workforce had no job , writes Crick .\nLike Margaret Thatcher , Howard is a Conservative by ideological conviction rather than class background .\nHoward made his career in the law and fought several elections unsuccessfully before entering Parliament in 1983 .\nModel Wife Along the way he married well .\nSandra Paul was a top 1960s fashion model who achieved the notable distinction of being the first English girl to make the cover of the American edition of Vogue for two months in a row .\nThe elegant Sandra , 64 , remains one of her husband s greatest electoral assets .\nHoward became Home Secretary in John Major s government .\nThere , he shifted crime policy decisively to the right .\n`` Howard saw the Home Office as one of the few departments to have escaped the Thatcher Revolution , and he felt that it was deeply imbued with the culture of what he called the criminal-justice establishment , writes Crick .\n`` He wanted to challenge its existing assumptions .\nLiberals , naturally enough , hated it .\nBut Labor has done nothing to reverse his policies , and most of the world has moved toward a tougher stance on crime since the early 1990s .\nIt is to Howard s credit that he got there first .\nHe is not just a politician who thinks deeply about the issues ; he also thinks about how to push change through the system -- often a much harder task .\nAfter losing the leadership to William Hague in 1997 , Howard finally became leader of his party in 2003 .\nCrick takes the fashionable view that the Conservative politician stands little chance against the formidable Blair .\n`` Howard seems to be leading his party to another calamitous defeat in the impending election , Crick concludes .\n` Tingle Factor `` Most successful politicians -- Tony Blair , Michael Heseltine , Michael Portillo , Bill Clinton -- inspire or excite , or at least interest the public , he continues .\n`` The nearest Michael Howard has to a tingle factor is his wife Sandra .\nLike many journalists , Crick tends to see politics as a branch of show business .\nHis list of `` successful politicians is revealing two men who didn t become Tory leader , and two left-wing politicians who , though electorally successful , achieved very little .\nThey are all people who were good at the `` show but not so good at the `` business .\nThe point Crick misses is that although Howard may be a relatively poor campaigner , who finds it hard to connect with ordinary voters , he is an effective administrator .\nThat contrasts with Blair , who is a brilliant campaigner but a shambolic administrator .\nWhat this biography actually tells us is that Howard would be an effective , possibly brilliant , prime minister .\nDo the voters care about that ?\nWe ll find out next month .\nLast Updated April 27 , 2005 00 09 EDT 2006 Bloomberg L.

S. in Mathematics , University of California at Berkeley After his graduation from UC - Berkeley , Howard helped develop operating systems and programming language compilers for Arpanet , though he didn t know that Arpanet would evolve into the global phenomenon called the Internet .\nAt the time , I thought it was amazing that all these different kinds of computers could talk to one another , and that scientists and researchers could talk with one another , Howard says .\nIt was all absolutely fascinating , but there was no way I imagined it was going to become what it is .\nStill a resident of northern California , Howard says he enjoys diving on the weekends for abalone , a single-valve mollusk that can be found attached to the rocks near shore at low tide .\nThe meat is delicate and tasty and so good .\nYou re allowed to collect three a day and up to 50 a year , and from three abalone you can get something like a pound or two of meat , Howard says .\nAfter I get a couple of hours in the water , I end up feeling as refreshed as if I had spent a couple of days in the mountains .\nLooking back , too much money was invested in the telecom industry .\nDid you know that at the time ?\nNo , I was caught up in it .\nEverything that people were thinking was going to happen will happen ; it s just that it hasn t happened as quickly as we thought .\nWe continue to see a doubling or tripling of Internet traffic every year .\nIt may not be every 90 days like it used to be , but there s still a lot of growth .\nFor one thing , there s video coming ; people will be able to get it as easily over their phones as on their TV at some point .\nAt times , some analyst firms have seemed partial to publishing hockey-stick-shaped charts predicting massive growth in various industry segments .\nWere you ever guilty of that ?\nI think one of the things Infonetics has always done is be more conservative in its predictions .\nWe don t just listen to manufacturers or carriers .\nWe try to find out who is buying what from manufacturers , and we check with manufacturers to see what they ve actually shipped , so that we can come up with realistic estimates .\nIs the management corruption uncovered lately at some telecom companies a reflection of the industry or simply a sign of the times ?\nI saw a quote from management consultant Peter Drucker a year or so ago that four times in the past 100 years we ve seen the pendulum swing back and forth between governments getting too lax on corporations , corporations taking advantage as a result , and the government getting tougher again .\nRight now I think you could say the pendulum is swinging back .\nCertainly , technology is changing the social fabric of the world , and when it s a time for entering new territory , the rules haven t really been written about how people should act , and so companies naturally take advantage .\nTelecom helps make possible the outsourcing of jobs like software development to countries outside the U. S. Do you think that s bad or good ?\nI think economies just have to adjust .\nA lot of people like to use the example of railroads in the 1800s .\nIt was a disruptive technology and it allowed communications to a better extent in that the mails were carried more quickly , and goods were more easily transported , and that changed the social order .\nTelecom isn t moving actual goods , but it s moving information , which is along the same lines , and it will have a huge impact on how people and governments around the world do business .\n3 GSM Is Money Transfer New Killer App ?\n-- February 12 , 2007 Ericsson Acquires Entrisphere For GPON And IPTV Technology Expertise -- February 12 , 2007 3 GSM LG Scoops 3 G For All Prize -- February 12 , 2007 AT T Picks QUALCOMM s Media FLO USA For Mobile Entertainment -- February 12 , 2007 3 GSM RIM Goes After Business With Black Berry 8800 Smartphone -- February 12 , 2007 Related articles Mark Dzuban , Vice Chairman of Cedar Point Communications -- February 1 , 2007 10 - Gbps LAN Transport -- February 1 , 2007 ECI Telecom All-in - One NID -- January 30 , 2007 Pannaway Jacobsrimell Enhanced Service Fulfillment and Management -- January 30 , 2007 Telecommunications Online Home | Subscriptions | Archives | Events | Advertise with Us | Editorial Calendar PDF Americas Issue | International Issue | News Globe | Tech Zones | Weblinks | About Us | Contact Us 2007 Telecommunications Magazine Online Horizon House Publications .\nAll rights reserved .\nPrivacy Policy .\nMichael Howard | February 1 , 2004 | Telecommunications Magazine\n',092

10 53 AM Print this article Email to a friend Michael Howard looks on as his leader bows out .\nPhoto AFP Most people who have had personal dealings with Michael Howard have found him an engaging and scrupulously polite individual .\nHe is articulate , as befits a QC , fiercely intelligent and honest .\nYet his image in the country is as a ruthless , Right-wing ideologue , someone who intimidated Whitehall officials and who places ambition ahead of principle .\nHe was once called the most hated home secretary in living memory .\nAnn Widdecombe , who served as his deputy at the Home Office , said there was something of the night about him , an opaque yet intentionally unflattering description that has stalked him ever since and probably always will .\nRarely in politics has the public persona so belied the private man .\nHow has this demonisation come about ?\nIt derives principally from his time as home secretary , when his insistence on tougher penalties for criminals offended the sensibilities of the liberals whose law and order policies had so palpably failed that the Tory government faced the gravest crime crisis in history .\nMr Howard s tough line - famously set out in his 27 points at the Conservative conference in 1993 - also found little favor with the judiciary , who felt that their independence was being constrained .\nThey fought his attempts at reform tooth and nail , feeding an impression of ministerial disarray that by then had infected the entire Tory government .\nYet there is little that Mr Howard proposed then that was not taken up by the Labor government in 1997 and built on subsequently by Jack Straw and now David Blunkett .\nThe penal slogan most commonly associated with Mr Howard is prison works .\nFrom the moment he became home secretary - a stewardship that began with the public angst generated by the appalling murder of Jamie Bulger by two 10-year-old boys - the prison population began to increase .\nBut this was not the direct consequence of any legislation , more a response by the courts to a perceived desire on the part of the public , articulated by politicians , for tougher sentences .\nMr Howard s most draconian measures , the so-called three strikes and you re out provision for repeat burglars and mandatory sentences for serial drug traffickers , were actually enacted by Labor after 1997 .\nFurthermore , the prison population has risen even faster under the current Government without its ministers attracting the same opprobrium .\nMr Howard s time at the Home Office was blighted by several high-profile prison escapes and there is no question that he might have handled the fall-out better .\nHe gave the impression of a politician seeking to blame his officials .\nDerek Lewis , the director general of the Prison Service , was fired .\nMiss Widdecombe s animus stems from this period .\nBut the fact remains that burglaries and car thefts began to fall from 1993 onwards , when measured by the British Crime Survey , which is the current Government s favored benchmark .\nIt is a record for which a home secretary might in other circumstances expect congratulations .\nMr Howard , however , merely endured brickbats .\nThis was as much a function of the terminal decline of the Major government , which Mr Howard came to epitomise , as a coherent critique of his achievements .\nHis earlier ministerial association with the poll tax - though his were not the only fingerprints at the scene - and the privatisation of water - now uncontroversial , then mightily divisive - contributed to the image .\nHis opposition to further European integration offended Europhile Tories at the time but is now mainstream party policy .\nAs home secretary , he made mistakes and suffered defeats .\nHe was probably wrong to increase the sentence tariff on the Bulger killers , but he felt it was his function to reflect public revulsion .\nLike Mr Blunkett , he wanted to introduce ID cards but was beaten back by a cabinet revolt .\nHe tried to limit trial by jury - just as the present Government is doing - but lost in the Lords .\nHe introduced an ill-considered ban on handguns , but after the Dunblane massacre the political pressure for prohibition was almost irresistable .\nHowever , there is a good deal of revisionism now taking place about Mr Howard s stewardship of the Home Office .\nHis predecessors , Douglas Hurd and Kenneth Clarke , are seen as too soft - during their time in the post , the crime level grew to more than five million .\nEven today , the criminal justice measures he wanted to introduce then are going through Parliament in one shape or another making it difficult for Labor to traduce his time at the Home Office .\nBorn in south Wales in 1941 , the son of Jewish immigrants from Romania , Michael Howard was educated at Llanelli Grammar School .\nHe went on to study law at Cambridge , where his debating skills made him a star of the Union .\nHis contemporaries included Kenneth Clarke , Norman Lamont , John Gummer , Leon Brittan and Norman Fowler , a group of friends who became known as the Cambridge mafia .\nTwo decades later , they occupied the upper reaches of the Thatcher and Major cabinets , though Mr Howard arrived at Westminster later after searching forlornly for a seat and then practising as a planning lawyer .\nIn the meantime he had married Sandra Paul , a Sixties model , who calls him an extraordinarily romantic man .\nThey have two children and one of the strongest of Westminster marriages .\nAfter he became MP for Folkestone in 1983 , his rise was meteoric and he reached the Cabinet within seven years .\nBy 1997 , he was well positioned to challenge for the succession to John Major yet secured just 23 votes from his fellow MPs , trailing in last .\nSome felt he was too clever by half ; others that he trimmed his sails according to the prevailing political winds .\nTheir suspicions were articulated by Miss Widdecombe .\nAt this point it must have been tempting to return to the Bar or earn a lot of money in the City .\nInstead , he took up the post of shadow foreign secretary under William Hague for two years before returning to the backbenches .\nWhen Iain Duncan Smith took over in 2001 , Mr Howard was the surprise choice as shadow chancellor , where he swiftly consolidated his reputation as a forensic and powerful Commons performer .\nYet while his qualities are known to his colleagues and his parliamentary skills are unquestionable , he will have the hardest task persuading voters that he is not an unfeeling and faintly sinister throwback to the Major era .\nIt is a caricature that Mr Howard s friends find hard to fathom .\nHis interests are catholic he likes football Liverpool is his team and horse-racing ; he enjoys a wide range of music from jazz to pop ; he rarely speaks disparagingly of colleagues , even in private - an unusual trait among politicians .\nHe is fiercely loyal .\nThroughout the recent Tory leadership fiasco few will have heard him utter anything derogatory about Mr Duncan Smith .\nHe was standing by the Tory leader outside Conservative Central Office on Tuesday just as he stood by Mr Major in his troubled times .\nIn his memoirs , Mr Major wrote Michael is clever and able , but in private is a shy and charming man , with an unstuffy , self-deprecating manner .\nHe was always at his best without an audience ; in public he could not help stirring things up .\nToo many people saw the polished barrister on the surface , and took against what they saw .\nThey missed the substance underneath .\nIf he becomes Tory leader , that substance will be sorely tested over the next two years .\nThe Telegraph , London Print this article Email to a friend Top Search all Fairfax archives \\* Fee for full article National | World | Opinion | Business | Technology | Sport | Entertainment | Multimedia World Sharon s Likud sags in Israeli local elections Brigitte reveals who gave orders Targets of ASIO raids consider legal action National Puplick referred for charges Grenade-toting PNG police seize Australian fish catch Flailing in the Oasis , council faces the sack Opinion Howard knows health and education are his weak points Bulk-billing s dismal decline Those men in tights Business Hertz adds Jag and Z4 to range $ A marches onward and upward Battle of words for Lend Lease US Office Technology I can see clearly now Liquid light Looking for the bigger picture Sport IOC look into re-testing Salt Lake samples Bosnich in assault probe Pittman rival shows positive to vogue drug Entertainment Westwood s Xmas gift Earning a place in the sun Grip on Sydney text | handheld how to membership | conditions | privacy Copyright 2003 .\nThe Sydney Morning Herald .\nadvertise | contact us\nAnother Howard man most likely to challenge Blair ? -

Environmentally-conscious property developer Michael Howard Homes is pulling out all the stops to ensure that two mature holm oak trees are protected during the construction of a luxury four-bedroom house in the village of Holbrook .\nThe Dedham-based developer has called in a specialist team of tree experts to carry out advanced new tree treatments , using the very latest in technology , to protect the roots of the holm oaks quercus ilex during the construction of a driveway to the new 435,000 property which is due to be completed in the summer .\nMike Dewhurst from Eastwood Tree Services in Coddenham said Taking the driveway over the root system of the trees is normally detrimental to the structure of the roots , but with new technology and materials the damaging effect can be dramatically reduced .\nWe will be feeding the root system by injecting into it special products that will develop the root system to become more efficient in extracting water and nutrients from the soil , thus enabling the trees to overcome the stress of the new entrance .\nThe root system of a mature tree can extend between one and two times the height and spread of the tree .\nThe main feeding roots of a tree are located within the first 200mm of the soil level so any compaction or soil removed will cause damage without specialist equipment being used .\nWe will be using a special air spade that allows us to excavate within the root system without any long-term damage to the health of the tree , added Mike Dewhurst .\nThis is cutting-edge tree care and our staff our fully trained in this new approach and we are specialists in this field .\nBuilders are not normally sympathetic to trees and Michael Howard Home s taking the trouble and expense to protect these holm oaks is an excellent example of a professional builder working with a professional tree company .\nThe driveway being installed over the root system will spread the weight of the vehicles by means of a very strong mesh allowing the weight to be spread over the roots .\nIt will be constructed of a porous material enabling the water to percolate into the root system and air and gases to be exchanged .\nAdrian Mann left Construction Director , Michael Howard Homes and Michael Dewhurst MD , Eastwood Tree Services , inspecting Holm Oak tree in Holbrook Pruning of Holm Oak and aerating soil without damaging vital root system Michael Howard Homes is experienced in building in conservation areas and builds properties with empathy for the area in which it is developing .\nThe protection of the environment in which we build is of great importance to us and we will invest wherever possible in the necessary support and services to enable us to maintain the environment during construction , said Michael Howard Homes construction director Adrian Mann .\nEastwood Tree Services was the obvious choice for this project as its staff are experienced and highly trained in this unusual field .\nThis is an expensive operation but we believe it is more than worth it to protect these beautiful old trees .\nThe holm oaks will be monitored over the next two years to make sure they retain their beauty in the village .\nThe new property , Holm Oaks , will be completed in August .\nIt is set on a secluded plot in the heart of Holbrook and will be of brick and tile construction , using reclaimed roof tiles .\nMichael Howard Homes specialises in designing , building and refurbishing individual properties of distinction and style , paying great attention to detail and using only the finest quality materials .\nFor further information please contact Caroline Gasking , Pink Creative Marketing and Communication on 01787 377565 or 07767 777800 Date Saturday 6th and Sunday 7th March

Dedham land made safe by local developer A controversial piece of contaminated and potentially dangerous land in the village of Dedham has been cleaned up by local property developer Michael Howard Homes and work has begun on building a brand new 1 million plus luxury home on the site .\nThe land , the site of the old gas works in Mill Lane , was so contaminated that it had become potentially harmful to the environment .\nMichael Howard Homes demolished former The Mallard restaurant on the site and cleared some 1500 tonnes of contaminated waste from the area to make it safe and suitable for development .\nThis was a very difficult and hugely expensive clean-up operation due to the extent of the contamination and the fact that the site is close to a river , said Adrian Mann , construction director of Dedham-based Michael Howard Homes .\nMichael Howard Homes consulted closely with Colchester Borough Council planners and the Dedham Vale Society to produced agreed plans for the new property , Millstream House , which will be a five-bedroom house featuring a four-car lodge and 1,000-bottle wine cellar .\nIt will be built using traditional methods and incorporating locally reclaimed materials .\nThe company is used to building on brownfield sites in conservation areas and builds properties with empathy for the area in which it is developing .\nMr Mann says that the appearance of the individually-designed Millstream House will be in keeping with the village of Dedham .\nMichael Howard Homes specialises in designing , building and refurbishing individual properties of distinction and style , paying great attention to detail and using only the finest quality materials .\nEnds For further information please contact Caroline Gasking , Pink Creative

'July 20th , 2005 2 01 pm Australia s Howard denies link between London bombings and Iraq war LONDON AFP - Australia s Prime Minister John Howard denied any link between the London bombings and the Iraq war as he visited two Australian victims of the attack during a trip to the British capital .\nHoward , who flew to Britain earlier in the morning from the United States where he met US President George W. Bush , was due to hold talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday as well as other senior ministers .\nAfter stopping at two London hospitals , he told reporters that one of the injured , Louise Barry , 29 , had asked him whether he thought the July 7 attack was related to the conflict in Iraq , which Australia has strongly supported .\nMy response was , I didn t believe it was , he told reporters .\nHoward said the motivation was the same as that which prompted the October 2002 bombing of a nightclub in Bali , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , which was before the March 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq .\nHe dubbed this driving force A perverted , twisted and totally immoral depiction of extreme Islam .\nEchoing words spoken Tuesday by Blair , Howard said , I remind you that terrorist attacks occurred before Iraq was on the radar screen , and those people who argue that this is really because of Iraq simply ignore those facts .\nHoward praised the courage of Barry , from Port Stephens , New South Wales , who has a serious neck injury after being caught in the blast on a Number 30 bus , and is recovering at London s University College Hospital .\nHe also had warm words for the other victim he visited , Gillian Hicks , 37 , from Adelaide , who was critically injured in one of the subway rail blasts , but is slowly improving at St Thomas s Hospital .\nI think both of them are quite remarkable , Howard said .\nUniversity College Hospital chief executive Robert Naylor said Barry was expected to check out in the next couple of days .\nIn total , nine Australians were injured in the explosions , including one who subsequently died , 28-year-old Sam Ly , 28 from Melbourne , who was also on the targeted bus .\nLater Wednesday , Howard was due to launch a two-year Australian contemporary arts program at a London hotel before going to the watch an Australian ballet , a spokeswoman for the Australian High Commission in London said .\nOn Thursday , he will hold separate meetings with Blair , finance minister Gordon Brown and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw , with a joint news conference planned with the British and Australian leaders .\nThe spokeswoman for the High Commission , the equivalent for an embassy for countries who are members of the Commonwealth , was unable to say what subjects would be covered in the talks , but said one would certainly be the London suicide bombings , in which at least 56 people died .\nHoward was scheduled to meet Defense Secretary John Reid on Friday and has also arranged to meet members of the main opposition Conservative Party , including leader Michael Howard .\nMichael Howard used John Howard s former chief strategist Lynton Crosby to help his party at the British general election in May , at which the Conservatives lost to Blair s Labor Party for the third straight time .\nThe Australian prime minister is spend the weekend privately -- likely to mean watching some of the Ashes cricket series between England and Australia -- before heading home .\nOther items in this section Latest News In The News The 06 Fix Katrina Updates Rosa Parks Day E-mails Facts in Mike s Films More of Latest News February 12th , 2007 5 38 pm Insurgents Stepping Up Efforts to Down U.

See Staffordshire County Council and Brian Goodacre as prime examples .\nThe major political parties are simply Chicken .\nThen as soon as the Human Rights Act looked set to give the common man a chance , they changed the rules regarding Legal Aid funding , making it almost impossible to obtain representation and justice .\nSpeaking before the Prime Minister traveled from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament , Mr Howard put his party on the front foot with a promise to do the best for Britain with an action program that would reward the hardworking law abiding majority , while delivering improved school discipline , cleaner hospitals , more police on the streets and controlled immigration .\nKicking off the party campaign in the courtyard of a central London hotel , he declared The choice before the voters on May 5 is very clear they can either reward Mr Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk ; or they can vote Conservative , to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons .\nInsisting that the Labor government has lost the plot , Mr Howard accused Tony Blair of taking honest hardworking people for granted , and failing to recognize how worried NHS patients are about hospital infections , how pensions are fearful of rising crime , and how parents fear that their children can not learn in class because of the lack of proper school discipline .\nDenouncing the way Labor has frittered away huge tax incomes with little improvement in public services , Mr Howard offered a better way which would help those who do the right thing and play by the rules .\nHe said the Conservative timetable for action would build a brighter , better future for the country , with more value for money and lower taxes , with discipline restored to schools , with hospital matrons given the power to close wards infected with MRSA ; with reduced crime , and an extra 5000 more police officers on the streets each year backed by tougher sentences for burglars and drug dealers ; and controlled immigration with an annual limit on the number of people who can settle in Britain .\nHe declared Some people say I shouldn t talk about difficult issues like the abuse of our asylum system and those travellers who stick two fingers up to the law .\nBut we can not make Britain a better place if we sweep difficult issues under the carpet .\nEveryone knows you won t fix a problem if you aren t even prepared to discuss it .\nMr Howard said he was not prepared to appease special interest groups , and wanted all Britons to play by the same rules .\nBuoyed up by improving opinion poll surveys and a party brimming with confidence and enthusiasm , Mr Howard said that while the Prime Minister was already secretly grinning about the prospect of his third victory , there was no reason why the country had to deliver Labor a third term in Downing Street .\nAnd in a clear message to the electorate he embarked on a vigorous four week nationwide campaign declaring If you re thinking what we re thinking , it s time for urgent action on the things that really matter reward for hardworking Britons ; school discipline ; cleaner hospitals ; more police ; and controlled immigration .\nSo I say again , the choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear .\nThey can either reward Mr. Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk .\nOr they can vote Conservative , to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons .\nMichael and Sandra Howard The issues that matter to hard working Britons Speech launching election campaign in the South , in Winchester The choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear .\nThey can either reward Mr. Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk .\nOr they can vote Conservative , to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons .\nConservatives will restore discipline in our classrooms by giving head teachers control over their schools .\nWe will clean up our hospitals by giving matrons the power to close wards that are infected with MRSA .\nWe will cut crime by each year putting 5000 more police officers - real police officers - on our streets and introducing tougher sentences for burglars and drug dealers .\nWe will reduce immigration by setting an annual limit on the number of people who can come and settle in Britain .\nAnd we will reward hardworking Britons by giving them value for money and lower taxes .\nPeople work hard for their money and they deserve to keep more of it .\nMr. Blair promised that he had no plans to increase tax at all .\nBut he has put taxes up 66 times - mostly by stealth .\nAnd it s hurting .\nAccording to the independent Institute for fiscal studies average incomes have started to fall for the first time in ten years .\nIt s not the rich getting soaked .\nIt is normal , hard working families trying to make ends meet .\nAnd if Mr. Blair gets in again taxes will go up again .\nRarely in the history of politics has a government spent so much , taxed so much and achieved so little .\nPeople work hard , they pay their taxes and they deserve value for their money .\nBut today , families are paying an average of 5,000 in extra tax a year - and what have they got to show for it ?\nEveryone knows there is no such thing as a free lunch .\nWith Mr Blair you pay for lunch and it never seems to turn up .\nBritain can not carry on indefinitely spending more than it is earning without higher taxes or higher interest rates .\nIf we are to secure our future economic prosperity , government must once again start to live within its means .\nThere are two Britains today private sector Britain , where people are working harder just to stand still , struggling just to make ends meet .\nAnd bureaucratic Britain , where money is no object , you spend what you like , you employ who you like .\nFor every job the private sector lost last year , the public sector took on almost two more .\nBritain can not carry on like this without storing up huge problems for the future .\nYou know a country is living on borrowed time when government is the fastest growing industry in town .\nSo we have a plan to get a grip on government spending .\nThat s why a Conservative government will cut waste .\nThere ll be 20 per cent fewer MPs , and 20 per cent fewer government ministers .\nOver 160 quangos will disappear .\n235,000 bureaucratic posts will go .\nWe ll scrap the New Deal .\nThere ll be no new Supreme Court .\nAnd as for those unelected , unaccountable regional assemblies , the playthings of John Prescott , we ll get rid of them too .\nYes , these decisions are tough - but they are right .\nRight because they ll get resources to the front line - to our schools and hospitals - giving taxpayers value for their money .\nRight because they ll help pay of debt and avoid Mr. Blair s tax rises .\nAnd right because they ll enable a Conservative to lower taxes .\nDo you really believe this man ?\nI believe that families are better at spending their hard earned cash than any politician .\nThat is why Conservatives will cut taxes .\nThe hardest hit by Labor s stealth taxes have been the older generation .\nIf you want to know about a family , look at how they treat their older relatives .\nAnd if you want to know about a country , look at how it cares for its older generation .\nHow a country treats the older generation is a test of its values .\nMany served our country in her greatest hour of need , fighting for liberty , freedom and Britain s independence for future generations .\nWe must never forget the contribution they have made - and continue to make to our communities .\nBut in Britain today too many pensioners are not shown the respect they deserve or given the dignity that is their due .\nThe older generation don t seem to feature in Mr Blair s New Britain .\nNew Labor s Britain is a country where the older generation has been airbrushed out .\nAs Frank Field , Mr Blair s own former social security minister , has said Labor took one of the best pensions systems in Europe and turned into one of the worst .\nPeople who saved for their retirement suddenly found that the money they d put aside simply wasn t there - that the value of their pensions had been destroyed by Mr Blair s stealth taxes .\nAnd Labor have forced nearly half all pensioners are onto means testing .\nPensioners quite rightly resent means testing .\nIt is at total odds with the values of the forgotten majority - the people who work hard , who take responsibility for themselves and save for their retirement .\nMeans testing is wrong .\nIt penalises people for doing the right thing - saving for their retirement .\nIt sends a clear signal to the younger generation Don t bother to save .\nSpend whatever you can before you retire , because your future is one of dependency on the State .\nMeans testing is humiliating - forcing pensioners to go cap in hand to the State for what they are due .\nAnd means testing is complicated .\nThat s why over one and a half million eligible pensioners don t even claim what they are owed .\nI want our country to honor our senior citizens , cherish their wisdom and care for their needs - a country where they can live in security and with dignity , respected and protected .\nTo those who have given so much , we must surely give what is their due .\nI will increase the basic state pension in line with earnings , making pensioners up to 11 a week better off after four years .\nBy increasing the basic pension , we will free hundreds of thousands pensioners from the tyranny of means tested benefits - restoring their dignity , independence and self-respect .\nI will give every home where the adults are sixty five and over a fifty per cent Council Tax discount up to a maximum of 500 .\nThis will ensure that Council Tax bills for five million pensioners are cut .\nTaken together these proposals will mean that pensioner households will be up to 1,000 a year better off - it s a thousand pounds .\nAnd I will stop the disgrace of elderly people being forced to sell their homes , saying goodbye forever to their independence , to pay for their residential care .\nSmile and wave goodbye to you taxes It s important that government rewards people who work hard and have contributed to our society .\nAnd it s important too that government upholds the law .\nSome people say I shouldn t talk about difficult issues like the abuse of our asylum system and those travellers who stick two fingers up to the law .\nBut we can not make Britain a better place if we sweep difficult issues under the carpet .\nEveryone knows you won t fix a problem if you aren t even prepared to discuss it .\nI m not prepared to appease special interest groups because I believe passionately in fair play .\nWe are all British and we should all have to play by the same rules .\nNor will I be distracted from doing what I believe is best for Britain by the smirking politics of Mr Blair or the woolly thinking of the Liberal Democrats .\nSo on each of these issues - on rewarding those who work hard and have contributed to our country , on schools , on hospitals , on crime and on immigration - we have a detailed , published Timetable for Action so you can hold us to account .\nLook for this commitment in your paper , check it on the net , put it up on your fridge door - hold me to it .\nAnd beware yet another election where Mr Blair says one thing to get your vote on polling day and does something quite different afterwards .\nMr. Blair is already secretly grinning about the prospect of his third victory .\nImagine five more years of him .\nWell you don t have to settle for it .\nIf you re thinking what we re thinking , it s time for urgent action on the things that really matter - Reward for hardworking Britons ; - School discipline ; - Cleaner hospitals ; - More police ; and - Controlled immigration .\nSo I say again , the choice before voters on May the fifth is very clear .\nThey can either reward Mr. Blair for eight years of broken promises and vote for another five years of talk .\nOr they can vote Conservative , to support a party that s taken a stand and is committed to action on the issues that matter to hard working Britons .\nCONSERVATIVE PARTY LINKS Newsroom News headlines Speeches Multimedia Blogs Recent press releases Articles Local Govt .\nResults News archive MEP news Media Centre News Syndication WAP \\/ PDA\nMICHAEL HOWARD CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT | GENERAL ELECTION VOTES TAX TAXATION RATES AND COUNCIL TAX .\n',047

Llanelli , Wales , as Michael Hecht .\nThe son of immigrants his father changed the family name after becoming a British subject in 1947 , he was educated at Cambridge and became a successful barrister .\nIn 1983 he was elected to Parliament , and in 1985 became a junior minister under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher .\nIn 1990 he became employment and environment minister , a post he continued to hold under Prime Minister John Major .\nAppointed home secretary in 1993 , he was known for his tough anticrime stance .\nAfter Major resigned as party leader 1997 , Howard sought unsuccessfully to succeed him .\nHowever , following Iain Duncan Smith s loss of the leadership post in 2003 , Howard won the position unopposed , becoming the first Jew to lead a major British party Disraeli had been baptized .\nHoward resigned as party leader following the Conservative loss in the 2005 elections ; he was succeeded by David Cameron .\nWikipedia Library -RRB- Reference -RRB- Wikipedia Michael Howard For other persons named Michael Howard , see Michael Howard disambiguation .\nThe Rt Hon.\nMichael Howard Michael Howard , QC born 7 July 1941 is a British politician and former Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Conservative Party from November 2003 to December 2005 .\nSince becoming an MP at the 1983 General Election , he also held a number of positions in successive Conservative governments until their electoral defeat in 1997 , most notably Home Secretary under John Major .\nEarly life Howard was born in Gorseinon , Wales , where his Romanian Jewish shopkeeper father Bernard Hecht had moved as an economic migrant 1 .\nHis mother , Hilda Kershion , was Welsh-born and of Eastern European Jewish ancestry .\nWhen Howard was six , the family name Hecht was anglicised to Howard 2 he has occasionally been referred to in later life as Michael Hecht or even Michel Hecht , usually by far-right and anti- Semitic people .\nHe attended Llanelli Grammar School and Peterhouse , Cambridge and was President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1962 .\nAfter taking a 2 1 in the first part of the Economics tripos , he switched to Law and graduated with a 2 2 in 1962 .\nHoward was one of a cluster of bright Conservative students at Cambridge around this time , sometimes referred to as the Cambridge Mafia , many of whom went on to hold high government office under Margaret Thatcher and John Major .\nSee Cambridge University Conservative Association He was called to the Bar Inner Temple in 1964 and specialised in employment law and planning issues .\nIn the 1966 election he fought the safe Labor seat of Liverpool Edge Hill , which led to his support for Liverpool F. C. .\nThe late 1960s saw his promotion within the Bow Group where he became Chairman in 1970 shortly after the general election in which he was again defeated at Edge Hill .\nAt the Conservative Party conference of 1970 , he made a notable speech commending the government for attempting to curbe trade union power .\nAt this time Howard was a leading advocate of British membership of the Common Market EEC and served on the board of the cross-party Britain in Europe group .\nHoward was named as co-respondent in the high profile divorce case of former 1960s model Sandra Paul .\nShe and Howard subsequently married in 1975 her fourth marriage ; their son Nicholas was born in 1976 and daughter Larissa in 1977 .\nUnlike his many Cambridge contemporaries , Howard found it difficult to find and be selected for a winnable parliamentary seat and so continued his career at the Bar where he became a Queen s Counsel in 1982 .\nIn June 1982 , Howard was finally selected for the constituency of Folkestone and Hythe in succession of the retiring the Sir Albert Costain .\nHe won his seat in the general election of 1983 without difficulty .\nCareer in Government Howard very quickly rose in the ranks of Government , becoming Parliamentary Under - Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry in 1985 with responsibility for regulating the financial dealings of the City of London .\nThis junior post became very important , as he oversaw the Big Bang introduction of new technology in 1986 .\nAfter the 1987 election he became Minister for Local Government .\nOn behalf of the Government , he accepted the amendment which would become Section 28 , and defended its inclusion .\nHoward then guided through the House of Commons the Local Government Finance Act 1988 .\nThis act brought in Margaret Thatcher s new system of local taxation , officially known as the Community Charge but almost universally nicknamed the poll tax .\nHoward personally supported the tax and won the respect of Mrs Thatcher for minimizing the rebellion against it within the Conservative Party .\nAfter a period as Minister for Water and Planning in 1988\\/89 during which he was responsible for implementing water privatization in England and Wales , Howard was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Employment in January 1990 with the resignation of Norman Fowler who left to spend more time with his family .\nHoward subsequently guided through legislation abolishing the closed shop and campaigned vigorously for Mrs Thatcher in the first ballot of the leadership contest in November 1990 .\nHe retained his cabinet post under John Major and campaigned against trade-union power during the 1992 general election campaign .\nHis work in the campaign led to his appointment as Secretary of State for the Environment in the reshuffle after the election .\nIn this capacity he encouraged the United States to participate in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , but he was soon after appointed as Home Secretary in a 1993 reshuffle initiated by the sacking of Norman Lamont .\nHis tenure as Home Secretary was especially notable for his tough approach to crime , which he summed up in the soundbite , prison works .\nHoward repeatedly clashed with judges and prison reformers as he sought to clamp down on crime through a series of tough measures .\nUnder his tenure , recorded crime fell for the first time in over 30 years .\nInfamous interview on Newsnight His reputation was dented on 13 May 1997 when a critical inquiry into a series of prison escapes was published .\nIn advance of the publication Howard made statements to assign blame to the prison service .\nA further controversy came when a television interviewer , Jeremy Paxman , relentlessly asked him the same question 12 times in all , and not the widely believed 14 times during an edition of the Newsnight program 3 .\nAsking whether Howard had intervened when Derek Lewis sacked a prison governor , Paxman asked Did you threaten to overrule him ?\nHoward did not give a direct answer , instead repeatedly saying that he did not overrule him , and ignoring the threaten part of the question .\nThe BBC subsequently revealed that the prolonged period where the question was repeated was in fact a filler to extend the interview , as technical reasons meant the next segment of that night s Newsnight was not ready for broadcast .\nWhile some praised the interview for journalistic toughness , others , including some in the BBC , criticised it as a theatrical stunt .\nThe interview remains one of the most infamous in broadcasting history .\nIn the longer term its precise impact on Howard s reputation remains disputed .\nSome suggest that it highlighted his arrogant refusal to answer the question ; others suggest that it highlighted his resilience and refusal to be bullied , even by one of Britain s toughest interviewers .\nHowever , in the same interview , an incredulous Paxman also asked Michael do you seriously expect to be leader of your party ?\n.\nIn a November 2004 interview see below Paxman returned to his question from 1997 .\nMr Howard was surprised , remarking Come on Jeremy , are you really going back over that again ?\nAs it happens , I didn t. Are you satisfied now ?\neh ?\n4 This was confirmed in 2005 , when under the Freedom of Information Act the Conservative Party obtained documents proving that Howard did not threaten to overrule Derek Lewis .\ncitation needed First attempt to become Conservative leader After the 1997 resignation of John Major , Howard and William Hague announced they would be running on the same ticket , with Howard as leader and Hague as Deputy Leader and Party Chairman .\nHowever , the day after they agreed this , Hague decided to run on his own .\nHoward also stood but his campaign was marred by attacks on his record as Home Secretary .\nHoward came in last out of five candidates with the support of only twenty-three MPs in the first round of polling for the leadership election .\nHe then withdrew from the race and endorsed the eventual winner William Hague .\nHoward served as Shadow Foreign Secretary for the next two years but would retire from the Shadow Cabinet in 1999 though re remained an MP .\nSomething of the night about him , claims Widdecombe Six days after the Derek Lewis incident on Newsnight , Ann Widdecombe , his former minister of state in the Home Office , made a statement in the House of Commons about the dismissal of then director of the Prison Service , Derek Lewis , and famously remarked of Howard that there is something of the night about him , a widely quoted comment that fatally damaged his 1997 bid for the Conservative Party leadership .\nThe comment was taken as a reference to his dour demeanor , which she implied was sinister and almost Dracula-like , and related to his Romanian ancestry .\nMelanie Phillips felt there was a hint of anti-semitism about the remark 1 .\nConservative Leader After the 2001 General Election Howard was recalled to frontline politics when the Conservatives new leader Iain Duncan Smith appointed him as Shadow Chancellor .\nHis performances as Shadow Chancellor won him much praise , indeed under his guidance the Conservatives decided to debate the economy on an Opposition Day for the first time since coming to power .\nAfter Duncan Smith was removed from the leadership , Howard was elected unopposed as leader of the party in November 2003 .\nAs leader , he faced much less discontent within the party than any of his three predecessors and was seen as a steady hand .\nHe avoided repeating such managerial missteps as Duncan Smith s firing of David Davis as Conservative Party Chairman , and imposed discipline quickly and firmly ; he removed the party whip from Ann Winterton following her telling of a racist joke .\nHis performances against Tony Blair at the despatch box were more effective than those of his predecessor as leader .\nHe was perhaps helped in all this by the Conservative Party s exhaustion after thirteen years of party turmoil following Margaret Thatcher s overthrow , years which had left the party more willing to unite and rally round a leader .\nIn February 2004 , Howard called on PM Tony Blair to resign over the Iraq war , for failing to ask basic questions regarding WMD claims and misleading Parliament 5 .\nIn July the Conservative leader stated that he would not have voted for the motion that authorised the Iraq war had he known the quality of intelligence information on which the WMD claims were based .\nAt the same time , he said he still believed in the Iraq invasion was right because the prize of a stable Iraq was worth striving for .\n6 His criticism of Blair did not earn Howard sympathies in Washington DC , where President Bush refused to meet him .\nKarl Rove is reported to have told Howard , you can forget about meeting the president .\nDon t bother coming .\n7 Michael Howard was named 2003 Parliamentarian of the Year by The Spectator and Zurich UK .\nThis was in recognition of his performance at the despatch box in his previous role as Shadow Chancellor .\nCrossing swords with Paxman In November 2004 , Newsnight again concentrated on Howard with coverage of a campaign trip to Cornwall and an interview with Jeremy Paxman .\nThe piece , which purported to show that members of the public were unable to identify Howard and that those who recognized him did not support him , was the subject of an official complaint from the Conservative Party .\nThe complaint claimed that the Newsnight team only spoke to people who held opinions against either Michael Howard or the Conservatives , and that Paxman s style was bullying and unnecessarily aggressive .\n2005 Election In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard s party failed to unseat the Labor Government , although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats -- five from the Liberal Democrats -- and Labor s majority shrank from 167 to 66 .\nThe Conservative share of the national vote only ticked up by 0.6 \% from 2001 and 1.6 \% from 1997 .\nHowever , because of the first past the post British voting system , the seats won in parliament for all parties did not reflect their proportionate overall share of the national vote .\nCommentators pointed to the state of Britain s constituency boundaries -- that heavily discriminated in favor of the Labor Party .\nIt is estimated that changes proposed by the Boundary Commission for England would result in a gain of 10-20 seats for the Conservatives with no change in the vote .\nThe day after the election , Howard stated in a speech in the newly-gained Conservative seat in Putney that he would not lead the party into the next General Election as he would be too old , and that he would stand down sooner rather than later , following a revision of the Conservative leadership electoral process .\nDespite the election of a third consecutive Labor government , Howard described the election as the beginning of a recovery for the Conservative party after Labor s landslide victories in 1997 and 2001 .\nHoward s own constituency of Folkestone and Hythe had been heavily targeted by the Liberal Democrats as the most sought after prize of their decapitation strategy of seeking to gain the seats of prominent Conservatives .\nYet Howard almost doubled his majority to 11,680 , whilst the Liberal Democrats saw their vote fall .\nCriticism of 2005 campaign During the 2005 campaign , Howard was criticised by some commentators for conducting a campaign which addressed the issues of immigration , asylum seekers and travellers , when he himself was the descendant of immigrants .\nOthers point out that the continued media coverage of such issues created most of the controversy and that Howard merely defended his views when questioned at unrelated policy launches .\nSome evidence suggested that the public generally supported policies proposed by the Conservative Party when they were not told which party had proposed them , indicating that the party still had an image problem .\ncitation needed Many middle class voters found Howard s perceived election campaign emphasis to be disagreeable amongst key ABC1 voters e.g.\ndoctors , lawyers , students , managers , the party s lead over Labor disappeared , compared with a 30-percentage-point lead under John Major in 1992 .\n8 The focus on immigration was widely alleged to have been influenced by Howard s election adviser Lynton Crosby , who has been alleged to have used similar tactics in Australian elections .\n9 Whether the hiring of Crosby was a good idea or not in hindsight , his organization of the campaign was credited with making the Conservative election drive much more professional and organised than at the previous election .\nDuring the campaign , Howard continued to impose strong party discipline , controversially forcing the deselection of Danny Kruger Sedgefield , Adrian Hilton Slough and Howard Flight Arundel South Downs .\nCash for Peerages On 23 October 2006 , Michael Howard revealed that he had voluntarily been questioned as a potential witness concerning the Cash for Peerages investigation surrounding fundraising and the 2005 election campaign .\nHe was not arrested or cautioned and is not suspected of any criminal activity .\n2 Final months as party leader Despite announcing after the 2005 General Election that he would vacate the role of party leader , Howard performed a substantial reshuffle of the party s front bench on the 10th May in which several rising star MPs were given their first shadow portfolios , in particular George Osborne and David Cameron .\nThis move cleared the way for David Cameron who had worked for Howard as Policy Advisor when Howard was Home Secretary to run for the Conservative Party leadership .\nThe reforms to the party s election process took a number of months and Howard held power as leader for six months of the new parliament .\nDuring that period , he enjoyed a fairly pressure-free time , often making joking comparisons between himself and Tony Blair , both of whom had declared they would not stand at the next General Election .\nHe also oversaw Blair s first parliamentary defeat , when the Conservative Party , the Liberal Democrats and sufficient Labor Party rebels voted against government proposals to extend to 90 days the period that terror suspects could be held for without charge .\nHoward stood down as leader in December of 2005 and was replaced by David Cameron .\nHoward announced on 17th March 2006 that he will be standing down as MP for Folkestone and Hythe at the next election , expected to be held in 2009 or 2010 10 .\nSee also List of the core beliefs of the Conservative Party of 2004 Official Opposition Shadow

British Public By Glenn Frankel Washington Post Foreign Service Wednesday , April 27 , 2005 ; Page A13 NOTTINGHAM , England -- Michael Howard was hammering home the need for more policemen on the beat before a television studio audience the other day in this city in central England where the rate of gun crime has soared in recent years .\nThe Conservative Party leader told the audience that his wife and daughter had been the victims of muggings in recent years , and he cited statistics indicating fewer criminals were being caught than at any time in the past two decades .\nWhat makes me really angry is the view that we have to settle for this , Howard said .\nIt doesn t have to be like this .\nMichael Howard , the leader of Britain s Conservative Party , is seeking to lead the Tories back into power after two consecutive landslide losses to Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Labor Party .\nBy Gareth Copley -- Associated Press Free E-mail Newsletters Today s Headlines Columnists See a Sample | Sign Up Now Breaking News Alerts See a Sample | Sign Up Now But just as Howard was warming to his theme , Glen Williams , deputy chairman of the Nottingham Black Police Association , interrupted .\nHe told Howard that his arguments on crime and immigration bordered on racism .\nThey are emotional and they are pandering to the basest fears of human nature , scolded Williams , who was in the studio audience .\nHoward stuck to his view , but his passion was clearly drained and he soon changed the subject .\nIt s been that kind of campaign for Howard , who is seeking to lead his party back to power in Britain s election next week after two consecutive landslide defeats at the hands of Tony Blair and the Labor Party .\nEvery time Howard s tight , disciplined and on-target approach appears to be getting traction with British voters , someone or something seems to come along to set him back again .\nUnder the guidance of Lynton Crosby , a campaign manager who has steered Australia s conservatives to four successive victories , Howard has kept to a script that has one slogan -- Are You Thinking What We re Thinking ?\n-- and just six campaign promises that can be boiled down to 12 words lower taxes , more police , controlled immigration , school discipline , cleaner hospitals , governmental accountability .\nThe party s manifesto -- only 18 pages long once the excess white space is removed -- is its shortest since 1966 .\nThe back-to-basics platform appears custom-made for two groups -- the party s right-of-center political base , and undecided voters who feel uneasy about the direction of British society and want someone to blame .\nStill , the campaign lacks the ideological fervor that former prime minister Margaret Thatcher once brought to the hustings .\nConservatives no longer are arguing that they would cut the size of government , but rather that they would run it more efficiently .\nPublic opinion polls suggest their case is not resonating with large numbers of voters .\nSurvey after survey shows the Conservatives a consistent 6 to 10 percentage points behind the Labor Party .\nThough the Conservatives traditionally do 2 to 3 points better than the polls predict , many analysts expect Blair to be returned to office , albeit with a reduced parliamentary majority .\nAnd the 300-year-old Conservative Party -- one of the most successful political organizations in the history of Western democracy -- is expected to go down to another defeat .\nAnalysts point to several reasons for the failure of the Tories , as the Conservatives are commonly known .\nSome blame Howard , a 63-year-old former lawyer and political veteran who was a cabinet secretary in the days of Thatcher and another former prime minister , John Major .\nHoward is considered a steady but decidedly un-charismatic candidate with a humorless , prosecutorial public persona .\nYears ago , a fellow Conservative said there was something of the night about Howard , a phrase that has stuck .\nThe campaign has also been criticized .\nSome analysts contend that the Tories pared-down agenda reads more like the shopping list of a party seeking to narrow the electoral gap rather than prepare for government .\nAnd like Williams , the police official , some critics contend that the campaign smacks of a racist agenda , especially the calls to reduce immigration .\nHoward , the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe , indignantly denies the racism charge .\nBut the rhetoric of some of the party s parliamentary candidates has fueled the allegation .\nWhat bit of Send them back don t you understand , Mr. Blair ?\ndemanded a leaflet for Bob Spink , a Tory candidate who wants illegal immigrants summarily expelled .\nConservative strategists argue that their program appeals at a gut level to voters who might not be prepared to admit to pollsters that they are attracted to it .\nCONTINUED 1 2 Next -RRB- Print This article E - Mail This article

Required Tools and Compiler Options Chapter 22 Threat Tree Patterns We kept the book short 352 pages to focus on the core elements of the SDL , rather than blathering on .\nAll the chapters are useful , but I think the most interesting chapters are these Ch 1 Really spells out the need for security and it has nothing to do with security !\nCh 3 Steve did a wonderful job of outlining the history of the SDL at Microsoft .\nIt s a real eye-opener and a very candid look into the security issues we , and the industry , face .\nCh 4 What managers need to know about implementing SDL , in terms of benefit and cost .\nCh 9 This is a highly updated and streamlined and more pragmatic look at our threat modeling and risk analysis framework , and it includes a real-world fully worked example .\nCh 12 This chapter introduces many security testing techniques , including fuzz-testing , and the book includes the source code for a file fuzzer .\nCh 15 Another Steve-chapter , this is an expos of the Microsoft security response process .\nAgain , it s very candid , outlining many of the lessons we have learned building the best response process .\nCh 18 There has been zero security guidance for Agile methods , until now .\nThis chapter was written in conjunction with the MSN and Windows Live team .\nCh 22 When we started threat modeling , we asked development teams to build threat trees .\nIt turns out that unless you know what you re doing , you will never build good threat trees .\nThen we realized that there are threat tree patterns that apply to the various threat types .\nThis chapter outlines all the threat trees and how you can use them to design and test your application .\nThe book includes a CD that includes a six-part video presentation of the Security Basics class we deliver to all new employees here .\nSteve and I are really excited about this book , in part because today is the day we sign off on it !\nThe galleys are all reviewed and the cover looks great .\nBut we re mostly excited because we believe this in an important book the first book to document REAL software development process improvements that yield more secure software .\nIt ain t perfect , and that s why we update the SDL twice a year , but it s a great start .\nThe book will be available in June this year .\nYou can find more info here http \\/ \\/ www.microsoft.com \\/ MSPress\\/books\\/8753 . asp .\nPosted Friday , April 28 , 2006 12 11 PM by michael _ HOWARD Filed under Security Comments Think Security -

instead it s the author s own thoughts and conclusions laid out in a simple manner .\nAs the historian in question is the highly respected Michael Howard , the thoughts and conclusions represent a lifetime of reading and rumination .\nReaders may initially think the book s subtitle - Reflections on War and International Order - is deceptive , despite an excellent introduction foreshadowing many later themes , because much of the text is broader in subject matter .\nHoward traces the many and changing roles of war alongside the evolution of European society and government , showing how both have been responsible for conflict and order .\nMoreover , Howard doesn t just illustrate how conflict , society , economics , politics and order are all intimately related , for he also provides a brisk sweep through the development of Europe as a whole across a period which begins with Charlemagne and ends just before the War Against Terrorism .\nI assume Howard is already working on a postscript to tackle this latter development .\nConsequently , The Invention of Peace is exhilarating to read , as entire epochs of history pass by in a concise discussion that is sometimes witty , sometimes sharp , but always thought-provoking .\nThis style does has its problems , as Howard s descriptions are so stripped down he has risked distortion simply by using too few words .\nAll the clarifications and safety guards of modern historiography have been excised , and if people wish to take issue with individual statements rather than the broader argument they may find plenty to argue about .\nOf course , that is also a point in the book s favor The Invention of Peace is both challenging and familiar .\nIn addition to the relationship between conflict and order , Howard also reflects on the relevant theologies and ideologies , as well as the emerging notion of peace , making as good a case as any that Immanuel Kant was responsible for our modern understanding of the term .\nCrucially , Howard never preaches , and he certainly never treats any of the philosophies or conflicts in anything other than the unbiased manner expected of all historians .\nA basic knowledge of broader European history is helpful , but not necessary , in order to understand this book which further emphasis how well written it is , and the argument swiftly flows past any specific events .\nEqually , Howard is - as we would expect - very well read , and his book is full of references that the less experienced may not fully understand .\nHowever , and provided you don t mind doing so , you can easily read past these incidents without damaging the book s impact , although you may want to visit some learned friends afterwards !\nOverall , The Invention of Peace is an excellent rumination on the nature and interplay of war and order , be it local or national , social or economic .\nThe book isn t for everyone - and it certainly isn t an introduction to European history - as the content is more theoretical than practical , more ideas than dates , and Howard has written for an educated and intelligent audience who do their own thinking .\nIt is left - quite rightly - to the reader to digest the author s thoughts and form their own conclusions .\nIndeed , The Invention of Peace is essential reading , not just for those interested in history , but for anyone interested in modern , and future , world affairs .\nThe discussion on whether intervention in a state s internal affairs by a foreign power reinforces or erodes the balance of peace , which occupies only two of the 133 pages , is still entirely relevant , and growing more so by the day .\nRelated Guide Picks Related Resources Top 10 Books Military - Specific Top 10 Books Military - General Top 10 European History Games Top 10 Books World War 1 Top 10 Books French Revolution Book Review Index Before You Buy Osprey Publishing 1 Before You Buy Osprey Publishing 2 Before You Buy Books Important product disclaimer information about this About site .\nFrom Robert Wilde , Your Guide to European History .\nFREE Newsletter .\nSign Up Now !\nRelated Articles The Builders The Invention of Peace by Michael Howard Top Picks - page 2 of 2 European History - Top Picks Books on Canada in World War II History 48 Hours in Vegas Plan Your Vegas Trip Guide to Vegas Shows Tips for Slots Players Vegas Wedding Chapels Best Vegas Bars What s Hot Glossary of Historical Terms Samuel Pepys Diary Rulers of the Ottoman Empire - Ottoman b. . .\nFutility by Wilfred Owen Mini biography of Pauline Bonaparte \\/ Borg ...

Howard By FRED W. WRIGHT JR. . St. Petersburg Timespublished June 17 , 2002 NEW POSITION Senior vice president , professional services group , Danka Business Systems , Rochester , N. Y.\nPREVIOUS POSITION Senior vice president , client solutions , Gartner Inc. , Stamford , Conn. .\nAlthough he will be based in Rochester , N. Y. , Michael Howard , newly appointed senior vice president of professional services at Danka Business Systems , will be spending at least a week a month at company headquarters in St. Petersburg .\nAnd there will be considerable travel outside that , he said , with regular trips to other U. S. major hubs of business , including Atlanta and points in Tennessee , Southern California , the New York City - Washington - Boston corridor and the Great Lakes area .\nI m pretty much used to being a road warrior , Howard said .\nHis role at Danka will be to consolidate the company s digital solution services to our customers mainly by organizing systems engineering as a singular group , he said .\nCurrently , such services are divided between high-volume and middle-volume business , and I want to link in the digital solutions centers so we have a seamless approach to building and prototyping our ongoing solutions for our customer support .\nDanka is very customer-intensive and very people-intensive , Howard said .\nThe way we make money in this business is to make sure our people are being employed at our customer sites and being valued for the work they can deliver on site , he said , and our revenue growth is dependent on acquiring talented people our customers can trust .\nHoward said he thinks the peripheral industry -- faxes , copiers , printers , multifunction machines -- is largely underused in offices .\nCustomers don t take advantage of them nearly as much as they could , he said .\nWe want to drive up the utilization and exploitation of these machines .\nHe said the future will bring even more opportunities for use in the traditional office , including voice-activation , video and music-streaming options .\nThat would all be part of the office solutions , he said .\nI ve long been tracking the document imaging work-flow industry , he said , and I always felt the peripheral manufacturers had a role .\nI think it s an industry that s not ever fulfilled itself .\nI hope to be part of that fulfillment at Danka .\nHoward said he recently attended his 25th class reunion at Princeton University , where he graduated in 1977 with a bachelor s degree in economics .\nUpon graduation , he joined General Electric s financial management training program in Milwaukee .\nBasically , I became very enamored of systems and decided I wanted to focus on that , he said .\nHoward joined Price Waterhouse as a systems consultant in 1982 , then four years later joined Gartner Inc. , a research and consulting company in Stamford , Conn. , as a consulting manager .\nHe left Gartner for six years , from 1994 to 2000 , to work for Xerox Corp. , then rejoined Gartner in its client solutions division .\nHoward describes himself as pretty much a computer nerd , but not on the extreme side .\nI didn t grow up as a programmer , but I ve been around computers since I started out of school .\nHoward is married and has three children .\nHe will turn 47 on July 4 .\nAs a kid , I grew up thinking those fireworks were for me , he said .\nI still have to have picnics and lots of hoopla around my birthday .\nPast 14 Days February 11 , 2007 February 10 , 2007 February 9 , 2007 February 8 , 2007 February 7 , 2007 February 6 , 2007 February 5 , 2007 February 4 , 2007 February 3 , 2007 February 2 , 2007 February 1 , 2007 January 31 , 2007 January 30 , 2007 January 29 , 2007 Search further back Back to Business 2006 All Rights Reserved St. Petersburg Times 490 First Avenue South St. Petersburg , FL 33701 727-893-8111 Contact the Times | Privacy Policy Standard of Accuracy | Terms , Conditions Copyright Special Links Stocks From the Times Business report Helping small businesses score points What s the SCORE ?\nNew ferrys may ply gulf s superhighway Sparks fly over Progress Energy subsidiary Which law firm do directors call first ?\nHold the phone Z - Tel issues positive report Profile Michael K.

illegally .\nI ve heard the old insult about someone being willing to sell their own grandmother to get ahead , but this is the first time I ve heard of someone willing to deport their own grandfather .\nConservative leader Michael Howard wants to introduce tougher laws on crime , including ending the early release system .\nWhen he was Home Secretary he released high-level drug dealer John Haase from prison just 10 months into an 18-year sentence , along with his associate Paul Bennett .\nA member of Haase s gang , Simon Bakerman , imprisoned for running an amphetamine factory , is Michael Howard s cousin .\nWe re a very close family , said Bakerman s mother .\nPeter Gasston | 17 02 , Saturday 12 February 2005 comment Mr Howards ancestry is interesting , perhaps if we looked more closely into the background of some of the many we seem to be welcoming with open arms Hamza etc this might be a safer place to live .\nPerhaps we should all take a closer look at our ancestry ?\nwe might not be so keen to knock back others .\nThe PM s father in law is a prime example of what we shoul all be aspiring to perhaps !!\nBut hey were not electing him , or Howard s grandad , make your choice from what you have , and chose the lesser liar with the smallest personal agenda .\nJohn | 18 13 , Saturday 12 February 2005 | link comment Why did Howard release two dangerous gangsters ?\nAs the Tory leader calls for criminals to be kept behind bars , police are investigating his role in a royal pardon for two men facing 18 years in prison .\nRobin Grant | 11 11 , Sunday 13 February 2005 | link comment Drug dealer tried to call Howard as trial witness Nick Rigby | 15 26 , Sunday 13 February 2005 | link comment And ?\nHow many of the current Labor government enjoyed free state education , and took part in peace movements - only to later actually get into power , try and trick the public into supporting war on a sovereign nation , and then starting charging for access to higher education ?\nPolitics is ugly , full stop .\nBrian | 15 46 , Monday 14 February 2005 | link comment Michael Howard the Scouse Gang Land Mister Big , John Haase .\nSo what s NEW ?\nHaase was given the kid gloves treatment in virtually exactly the same fashion as a previous Liverpool Drugs Baron , Curtis Warren .\nAnd his Middlesbrough underling , Brian Carrington .\nIn the early l990s , + 2million was discovered in the property of used car dealer Charrington .\nWhilst on remand in Strangeways , Charrington was assisted in a move to a North -

'Michael Howard From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation , search For other persons named Michael Howard , see Michael Howard disambiguation .\nRt Hon Michael Howard QC MP The Rt Hon Michael Howard QC MP , born 7 July 1941 is a British politician , former Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Conservative Party from November 2003 to December 2005 .\nSince his election as an MP at the 1983 General Election , Howard also held a number of positions in successive Conservative governments until their electoral defeat in 1997 , most notably Home Secretary under John Major .\nContents 1 Early life 2 Career in Government 2.1 Infamous interview on Newsnight 3 First attempt to become Conservative leader 3.1 Something of the night about him , claims Widdecombe 4 Conservative Leader 4.1 Crossing swords with Paxman again 5 2005 Election 5.1 Criticism of 2005 campaign 5.2 Cash for Peerages 6 Final months as party leader 7 See also 8 References 9 External links edit Early life Howard was born in Gorseinon , Wales , the son of immigrant Romanian Jewish shopkeeper Bernard Hecht 1 .\nHis mother , Hilda Kershion , was Welsh-born and of Eastern European Jewish ancestry .\nWhen Howard was six , the family name Hecht was anglicised to Howard 2 .\nHe attended Llanelli Grammar School and Peterhouse , Cambridge and was President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1962 .\nAfter taking a 2 1 in the first part of the Economics tripos , he switched to Law and graduated with a 2 2 in 1962 .\nHoward was one of a cluster of bright Conservative students at Cambridge around this time , sometimes referred to as the Cambridge Mafia , many of whom went on to hold high government office under Margaret Thatcher and John Major .\nSee Cambridge University Conservative Association Howard was called to Bar Inner Temple in 1964 and specialised in employment law and planning issues .\nThe late 1960s saw his promotion within the Bow Group where he became Chairman in 1970 .\nAt the Conservative Party conference of 1970 , he made a notable speech commending the government for attempting to curb trade union power .\nUnlike his many Cambridge contemporaries , Howard found it difficult to find and be selected for a winnable parliamentary seat and so continued his career at the Bar where he would become a Queen s Counsel in 1982 .\nIn June of that year Howard was selected for the constituency of Folkestone and Hythe in succession of the retiring the Sir Albert Costain .\nHe won his seat in the general election of 1983 without difficulty .\nHoward had previously twice fought and lost the safe Labor seat of Liverpool Edge Hill , in 1966 and 1970 these early races led to his support for Liverpool F. C. .\nIn the 1970s Howard was a leading advocate of British membership of the Common Market EEC and served on the board of the cross-party Britain in Europe group .\nHoward was named as co-respondent in the high profile divorce case of 1960s model Sandra Paul .\nShe and Howard subsequently married in 1975 her fourth marriage ; their son Nicholas was born in 1976 and daughter Larissa in 1977 . edit Career in Government Howard very quickly rose in the ranks of Government , becoming Parliamentary Under - Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry in 1985 with responsibility for regulating the financial dealings of the City of London .\nThis junior post became very important , as he oversaw the Big Bang introduction of new technology in 1986 .\nAfter the 1987 election he became Minister for Local Government .\nOn behalf of the Government , he accepted the amendment which would become Section 28 , and defended its inclusion .\nHoward then guided through the House of Commons the Local Government Finance Act 1988 .\nThis act brought in Margaret Thatcher s new system of local taxation , officially known as the Community Charge but almost universally nicknamed the poll tax .\nHoward personally supported the tax and won the respect of Mrs Thatcher for minimizing the rebellion against it within the Conservative Party .\nAfter a period as Minister for Water and Planning in 1988\\/89 during which he was responsible for implementing water privatization in England and Wales , Howard was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Employment in January 1990 with the resignation of Norman Fowler .\nHoward subsequently guided through legislation abolishing the closed shop and campaigned vigorously for Mrs Thatcher in the first ballot of the leadership contest in November 1990 .\nHe retained his cabinet post under John Major and campaigned against trade-union power during the 1992 general election campaign .\nHis work in the campaign led to his appointment as Secretary of State for the Environment in the reshuffle after the election .\nIn this capacity he encouraged the United States to participate in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , but he was soon after appointed Home Secretary in a 1993 reshuffle initiated by the sacking of Norman Lamont .\nHis tenure as Home Secretary was especially notable for his tough approach to crime , which he summed up in the sound bite , prison works .\nHoward repeatedly clashed with judges and prison reformers as he sought to clamp down on crime through a series of tough measures .\nUnder his tenure , recorded crime fell for the first time in over 30 years by a record 18 \% , a feat achieved neither before or since .\nedit Infamous interview on Newsnight His reputation was dented on 13 May 1997 when a critical inquiry into a series of prison escapes was published .\nIn advance of the publication Howard made statements to assign blame to the prison service .\nA further controversy came when a television interviewer , Jeremy Paxman , relentlessly asked him the same question 12 times in all , and not the widely believed 14 times during an edition of the Newsnight program 3 .\nAsking whether Howard had intervened when Derek Lewis sacked a prison governor , Paxman asked Did you threaten to overrule him ?\nHoward did not give a direct answer , instead repeatedly saying that he did not overrule him , and ignoring the threaten part of the question .\nThe BBC subsequently revealed that the repetition of the question was in fact a filler to extend the interview , as the next segment of Newsnight was not ready for broadcast .\nThe interview remains one of the most infamous in broadcasting history .\nIn the longer term its precise impact on Howard s reputation remains disputed .\nSome suggest that it highlighted his arrogant refusal to answer the question ; others suggest that it highlighted his resilience and refusal to be bullied , even by one of Britain s toughest interviewers .\nHowever , in the same interview , an incredulous Paxman also asked him do you seriously expect to be leader of your party ?\n.\nIn a November 2004 interview see below Paxman returned to his question from 1997 .\nMr Howard was surprised , remarking Come on Jeremy , are you really going back over that again ?\nAs it happens , I didn t. Are you satisfied now ?\n4 This was confirmed in 2005 , when under the Freedom of Information Act the Conservative Party obtained documents proving that Howard did not threaten to overrule Derek Lewis .\ncitation needed edit First attempt to become Conservative leader After the 1997 resignation of John Major , Howard and William Hague announced they would be running on the same ticket , with Howard as leader and Hague as Deputy Leader and Party Chairman .\nHowever , the day after they agreed this , Hague decided to run on his own .\nHoward also stood but his campaign was marred by attacks on his record as Home Secretary .\nHoward came in last out of five candidates with the support of only twenty-three MPs in the first round of polling for the leadership election .\nHe then withdrew from the race and endorsed the eventual winner William Hague .\nHoward served as Shadow Foreign Secretary for the next two years but would retire from the Shadow Cabinet in 1999 , though remaining an MP .\nedit Something of the night about him , claims Widdecombe Six days after the Derek Lewis incident on Newsnight , Ann Widdecombe , his former minister of state in the Home Office , made a statement in the House of Commons about the dismissal of then director of the Prison Service , Derek Lewis , and famously remarked of Howard that there is something of the night about him , a widely quoted comment that fatally damaged his 1997 bid for the Conservative Party leadership .\nThe comment was taken as a reference to his dour demeanor , which she implied was sinister and almost Dracula-like , and related to his Romanian ancestry .\nMelanie Phillips felt there was a hint of anti-semitism about the remark 1 .\nedit Conservative Leader After the 2001 General Election Howard was recalled to frontline politics when the Conservatives new leader Iain Duncan Smith appointed him Shadow Chancellor .\nHis performances in the post won him much praise , indeed under his guidance the Conservatives decided to debate the economy on an Opposition Day for the first time in several years .\nAfter Duncan Smith was removed from the leadership , Howard was elected unopposed as leader of the party in November 2003 .\nAs leader , he faced much less discontent within the party than any of his three predecessors and was seen as a steady hand .\nHe avoided repeating such managerial missteps as Duncan Smith s firing of David Davis as Conservative Party Chairman , and imposed discipline quickly and firmly ; he removed the party whip from Ann Winterton following her telling of a racial joke .\nHis performances against Tony Blair at the despatch box were more effective than those of his predecessor as leader .\nHe was perhaps helped in all this by the Conservative Party s exhaustion after thirteen years of party turmoil following Margaret Thatcher s overthrow , years which had left the party more willing to unite and rally round a leader .\nIn February 2004 , Howard called on PM Tony Blair to resign over the Iraq war , for failing to ask basic questions regarding WMD claims and misleading Parliament 5 .\nIn July the Conservative leader stated that he would not have voted for the motion that authorised the Iraq war had he known the quality of intelligence information on which the WMD claims were based .\nAt the same time , he said he still believed in the Iraq invasion was right because the prize of a stable Iraq was worth striving for .\n6 His criticism of Blair did not earn Howard sympathies in Washington DC , where President Bush refused to meet him .\nKarl Rove is reported to have told Howard , you can forget about meeting the president .\nDon t bother coming .\n7 Michael Howard was named 2003 Parliamentarian of the Year by The Spectator and Zurich UK .\nThis was in recognition of his performance at the despatch box in his previous role as Shadow Chancellor .\nedit Crossing swords with Paxman again In November 2004 , Newsnight again concentrated on Howard with coverage of a campaign trip to Cornwall and an interview with Jeremy Paxman .\nThe piece , which purported to show that members of the public were unable to identify Howard and that those who recognized him did not support him , was the subject of an official complaint from the Conservative Party .\nThe complaint claimed that the Newsnight team only spoke to people who held opinions against either Michael Howard or the Conservatives , and that Paxman s style was bullying and unnecessarily aggressive .\nedit 2005 Election In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard s party failed to unseat the Labor Government , although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats -- five from the Liberal Democrats -- and Labor s majority shrank from 167 to 66 .\nThe Conservative share of the national vote increased by 0.6 \% from 2001 and 1.6 \% from 1997 .\nCommentators pointed to the state of Britain s constituency boundaries coupled with the first past the post British voting system , which together heavily discriminate in favor of the ruling Labor Party .\nIt is estimated that changes proposed by the Boundary Commission for England would result in a gain of 10-20 seats for the Conservatives with no change in the vote .\ncitation needed Despite the third consecutive loss , Howard received much praise for the election results , which bought forward strong elections policy on crime , immigration and tax freedom day .\nThe day after the election , Howard stated in a speech in the newly-gained Conservative seat in Putney that he would not lead the party into the next General Election as he would be too old , and that he would stand down sooner rather than later , following a revision of the Conservative leadership electoral process .\nDespite the election of a third consecutive Labor government , Howard described the election as the beginning of a recovery for the Conservative party after Labor s landslide victories in 1997 and 2001 .\nHoward s own constituency of Folkestone and Hythe had been heavily targeted by the Liberal Democrats as the most sought after prize of their failed decapitation strategy of seeking to gain seats from prominent Conservatives .\nYet Howard almost doubled his majority to 11,680 , whilst the Liberal Democrats saw their vote fall .\nedit Criticism of 2005 campaign During the 2005 campaign , Howard was criticised by some commentators for conducting a campaign which addressed the issues of immigration , asylum seekers and travellers , when he himself was the descendant of immigrants .\nOthers point out that the continued media coverage of such issues created most of the controversy and that Howard merely defended his views when questioned at unrelated policy launches .\nSome evidence suggested that the public generally supported policies proposed by the Conservative Party when they were not told which party had proposed them , indicating that the party still had an image problem .\nConservative John Major s 30 \% lead in 1992 amongst the sought after ABC1 voters e.g.\ndoctors , lawyers , students , managers had all but disappeared by 2005 .\n8 The campaign focus on immigration may have been influenced by Howard s election adviser Lynton Crosby , who earlier had run similar tactics in Australian elections .\n9 Whether the hiring of Crosby was a good idea or not in hindsight , his organization of the campaign was credited with making the Conservative election drive much more professional and organised than at the previous election .\nDuring the campaign , Howard continued to impose strong party discipline , controversially forcing the deselection of Danny Kruger Sedgefield , Adrian Hilton Slough and Howard Flight Arundel South Downs .\nedit Cash for Peerages On 23 October 2006 , Michael Howard revealed that he had voluntarily been questioned as a potential witness concerning the Cash for Peerages investigation surrounding fundraising and the 2005 election campaign .\nHe is not suspected of any criminal activity .\n2 edit Final months as party leader Despite announcing after the 2005 General Election that he would vacate the role of party leader , Howard performed a substantial reshuffle of the party s front bench on the 10th May in which several rising star MPs were given their first shadow portfolios , including George Osborne and David Cameron .\nThis move cleared the way for David Cameron who had worked for Howard as Policy Advisor when the latter was Home Secretary to run for the Conservative Party leadership .\nThe reforms to the party s election process took a number of months and Howard held power as leader for six months of the new parliament .\nDuring that period , he enjoyed a fairly pressure-free time , often making joking comparisons between himself and Tony Blair , both of whom had declared they would not stand at the next General Election .\nHe also oversaw Blair s first parliamentary defeat , when the Conservative Party , the Liberal Democrats and sufficient Labor Party rebels voted against government proposals to extend to 90 days the period that terror suspects could be held for without charge .\nHoward stood down as leader in December of 2005 and was replaced by David Cameron .\nHoward announced on 17th March 2006 that he will be standing down as MP for Folkestone and Hythe at the next election , expected to be held in 2009 or 2010 10 .\nedit See also Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet UK edit References ^ The chosen person , Melanie Phillips , Jewish World Review , November 10 , 2003 ^ Howard quizzed

C. Olympics Pie - Eating Event .\nDracula is famous because he s the star of the book Dracula by Barn Stoker , a man who got his name from his former job , which was stoking the fires of barns .\nHe wrote the book while in prison for arson , having been caught stoking a barn-burner in the hayloft of a former employer .\nIt is well known that Dracula wants nothing more then to bring about our DIOBOLICAL DOOM !\nThis ambition has won him several Pulzer prizes and the Salvation armys medal of charatainment .\nHe s also a great admirer of the cinema .\nBoth directing and co-starring with other icons such as Frankenstein and Abbott and Costello .\nHe was inspired by fellow immortal Clint Eastwood and his never ending work as the goodest baddest and ugliest man in Hollywood .\nSince 1167 Dracula is bloodthirsty , cause he was the best blood donor in world , with his 23 Barrels of hot , donored blood .\nDracula hates dead links and the color red .\nedit What s a Dracula ?\nAn umpire ; someone who makes sure that the rules of cricket are strictly obeyed .\nAlso , weird Romanian music teachers at Devon Prep .\nDracula fought with Moses in a power struggle over the divine delicacy , takoyaki , on the summit of Takoyama .\nMoses Then used the Ten Commandments to behead the vampirous villian , shattering them into the fragments that make up the archipelago of North Dakota .\nTo this God said , Crap in a bag , not again ! .\nDracula has the power to summon Linkin Park to write a song called One Step Closer for the film Dracula 2000 .\nHe can control wolves too .\nFind a werewolf and ask him or her if he can control werewolves .\nIn 1945 , he took part in a titanic power struggle with Francis Ford Coppola over control of Harbor Seals , Inc. . At a press conference in March of that year , Mr. Dracula reportedly made not one , but two nasty comments concerning Mr. Coppola s poker club .\nSeveral days later , on March 27 , Mr. Dracula was found dead in a hospital .\nOf his untimely death , Soviet leader Joseph Stalin commented , Ha !\nThe corrupt bureaucrat !\nHe isn t dead !\nI bet my life that he s still out there , probably disguised as your best friend .\nOddly enough , Mr. Stalin died soon after .\nSo much for betting his life .\nWe have fairly convincing evidence that he is in fact living among the Dimdii of Papua New Guinea .\nAfter many years of quietly living amongst the Dimdii , his insatiable desire for DIABOLICAL DOOM took over once again and he returned to the modern world incognito .\nHe changed his name to Illpalazzo and wore a very faggy outfit to hide his identity while he created alliances with Big Boss , General Mills , Space Pirates , and other unmentionables .\nHe lead an effort to dominate the world and create a communist utopia in the year 1999 through a series of terrorist activities which set off the aptly named Demon Castle Wars of 1999 The Breakfast War , The Console War , The Super Robot War , The Bankers War , Class War X , The Sequel War and many other sub-wars .\nAfter a series of victories , the turning point came when Big Boss discovered he was actually working with Dracula , freaked out and switched sides .\nThings went downhill from there and Dracula was eventually apprehended by agents of CTU Japan and imprisoned .\nIn prison however , he was roomed with a crack-high man who repeatedly ass-raped him in the showers .\nThis man later turned out to be Julius Belmont who claimed he ended Dracula s reign of terror after re-hab This fucked up his ability to reincarnate every 100 years and thus after dying in prison he lost sense of who he was and was re-born as a teenager known as Soma Cruz with no memory of his former self .\nThough he still has nightmares about the ass-raping It is assumed that one day Dracula will return to his former self some day and return to the ways of communsism .\nedit Fictional In the year 1979 , scientists constructed the Superconducting Supercollider in an attempt to verify whether Dracula , or everybody else , is a fictional character .\nResearch is ongoing , though progress is slow as most of the original team have been drained of blood and stuffed into the beamline .\nIt is a little-known fact that Dracula revives every 100 years , and he teleports around a big fancy throne room while shooting fireballs from his crotch , only to be whipped to death by some guy in a leather mini-skirt .\nWhether this is true or not is explored in the Cool Spot non-video game series .\nWhile popular rumor has it that the Castlevania series explores these stories , that is not true ; see the Castlevania article for more details .\nHowever , Dracula is also known to be very interested in the sales of the Castlevania storybooks .\nedit little story of Dr cula Vlad Drakul , the dragon , in rumain , was the hero in the war against the turkish in the XVII century .\nLandlord , made explotaition over the rumain yeomens .\nThe gipsis made your protection , payed with gold and botins .\nVlad was iluminated , knowledge the works of Leonardo Da Vinci , had a black bat delta-wing , made terror over de rumains yeomens of transilv nia .\nAt day , or night , falled with your delta-wing and crash floor .\nMany cristians rumains yeomens said of santa claus who crash air with the black bat delta-wing , others said of a little owl who crash air .\nedit See also Count Duckula The Count Count Chocula Transylvania Vlad the Impaler Vlad Masters Tom Cruise Romania and the What I Didn t Know about Romania series of articles .\nElected officials Jerry Seinfeld Gackt Vampires Blackula Undead Igor Biscan Castlevania Ozzy Osbourne Jason White v d e The Axis of Evil - Doers Supreme Rulers , Bert , Jimbo Wales , Oprah Winfrey , Adolf Hitler , Emperor Palpatine , Satan , Jack Chick , Monty Panesar , Bob the Builder , The King , Dick Cheney Comics Committee Pikachu , Mr.\nFreeze , Lex Luthor , Urho Kekkonen , Doctor Doom , Megatron , Venom Space Committee Dr. Nefarious , The Zimii , Chairman Drek , Darth Vader , Khan Noonien Singh , Xenu , L.

System Security Tought with linux machines ... and pretty much we learned basic hacking techniques .\nThen the second half of the course was implementing what we learned to a box and try to keep hackers out of our machines .\nVery intersting to learn how a WHOIS and a HOST command can really screw up a machine ... adwb mm2 Wed , Apr 7 2004 3 52 AM I know quite a few people who have been hired recently by Microsoft from WWU my current location of study and I happen to know that the security courses are few and far between .\nBeing a computer science student here at WWU has made me realize that this is not the place I want to continue my education .\nThe instructors don t seem interested in what they teach and the selection of courses is very focused on doing good math using a dated programming language .\nI have to say that I have had one instructor who is very interested in security and writing quality code .\nCoincidentally he teaches only one class per quarter and runs a local software company during the day .\nI d go as far as to say he s not even a real professor .\nSo that reduces the number of excellent security instructors to nill at WWU .\nnasserd Wed , Apr 7 2004 3 30 PM My inaugural post to Channel9 hoorah !\nI ve been on the software side of things for almost a decade now ; however only left college barely 2 years ago .\nFrom what I ve seen from the insides of schools public , private ... ivy , quasi-ivy , non-ivy ...\nTier 1 , and Tier 2 whose curriculums I ve investigated , here s a shortlist of their courses \\* Whiz-bang animation courses \\* OOP using Java ; now more with C # , .\nNET \\* EE approaches to software dev t \\* Starting a software biz \\* n-tier system ... how they work .\nVery little has anything to do with security .\nWhen the CS graduates look for jobs , they say wait , they can do that ?\nOr , Naw , that s not what I was taught .\nOkay , enough ramble .\nLong story short , students barely know what to look for ... and schools as always rely on student interests to build a popular field of study .\nIn the end , as was previously mentioned , since schools don t know what to offer and don t know who can teach it , the students are unable to learn .\nAnd the vicious cycle makes another round ... timothyblek bah !\nWed , Apr 7 2004 6 43 PM My first poast as well !\nI think alot of what is taught in schools comes from teaching to the lowest common denominator .\nI participate on an advisory board every year at the local community college where I also teach part time .\nThis year I came across something interesting .\nWe basically ran into two schools of thought 1 teach basic classes to get the high school kids up and running with computer and programming classes and on to a good 4 year or jr. programming job .2 teach really cool , but very advanced classes on security mostly network though , knowing that we re going to be catering to businesses out there educating their employees though our certificate programs .\nObviously , teaching Hello World isn t as sexy or fun as an advanced class on securing a Linux firewall , so competent teachers want to have the fun courses .\nUltimately , schools must make money though , or they can t pay us teachers , so the fresh meat get the basic programming classes , not exciting at all , mostly because it is a struggle to fill these student s heads with good programming practices and we spend a large portion of time just with flow control and the concepts of OOP .\nThat leaves the middle ground , a sort of no man s land .\nAt what point is it appropriate to introduce a programmer to security concepts ?\nBefore or after they learn what a switch statement is ?\nBefore or after they learn to connect to a database ?\nAlso , look at the job postings today , people are asking for things like a year of C # , 5 years RDMS , 3 years OOP .\nI have very rarely seen a request for something like 1 year secure programming experience anduril Tue , Jun 8 2004 6 24 PM I m not a programmer , well not outside of being a hobbyist .\nI enjoy doing some programming on the side in my free time so of course I m not going to be taught how to write secure code .\nThey re interested in attempting to pass a decent amount of us , students who couldn t code if their lives depended on it .\nGranted , my school does offer quite a few security courses that don t focus on writing secure code but rather creating a secure system enviroment , network , what not .\nI m an IST major , not CS ryanlowe Wed , Jun 9 2004 1 43 PM You will be happy to know that the Software Engineering program at the University of Ottawa has a required security course for all fourth year students .\nIt was quite comprehensive , covering threat modelling , encryption , digital signatures .\nI very much enjoyed going to the class and the content was very interesting .\nI agree that generally developers are either ignorant or don t care enough about security issues though .\nRyan Lowe University of Ottawa Software Engineering class of 04 lars Fri , Jun 11 2004 7 15 AM Well , looking just a few years back maybe Microsoft wasn t a company that took security seriously either .\nAs the demand for people with security training increases I m sure colleges will deliver . \\/ Lars .\narun_coorg Arun World is Flat Friedman Sun , Jun 5 2005 12 52 AM Hi , College can teach some basic security aspects .\nBut it never teaches the real time stuffs .\nI am doing Masters in Cybersec but when I go on with latest hacks and stuffs , I find my study is nothing .\nThe latest technology threats are not at all included nor exposed in any university .\nMicrosoft might have not considered about security when they came into business or technology but they must provide information abt such things to the college which can be a part of study updating regularly .\nTranining is definately required when a grad student goes out of hos college Arun .\nP.

now we re onto Windows Server 2003 , SQL Server , Microsoft Office , the next big Visual Studio .\nNET release , and much , much more .\nMSDN What do you see as the biggest challenge that developers face while trying to code secure applications ?\nHoward Legacy code is definitely the biggest challenge in that respect .\nWe think we have the new code pretty much solved .\nPeople know the right things to do now that we have provided mandatory training , set security rules in place , improved the tools , and created a huge security awareness company-wide .\nHowever , attackers target legacy code as well as new code , and the role of the various security pushes is to fix issues in both old and new code .\nWe can task people here at Microsoft to review and fix all code , old and new , and make it part of their job .\nMSDN What security features would you like to see incorporated into future Microsoft products ?\nHoward I would like to see people not focus on security features .\nIn fact , I truly believe that the biggest security benefit we can provide our customers is to install only critical features by default .\nIf the user wants to enable other features , then they should be optional installs .\nI say this because we can create products that defend against the threats we know about today .\nOf course , there will be new threats in the future that we do not know about today , and if a feature has such a vulnerability and it is installed by default , the user of that particular feature is automatically susceptible to attack and will need to deploy a security fix quickly .\nHowever , if the feature is rarely used and not running by default , then it can not be attacked .\nTherefore , the path deployment urgency is vastly reduced .\nIn short , if a feature is not used by 90 percent of the product s users , then the feature should be disabled by default .\nFrom the March 2003 issue of MSDN Magazine .\nBack to top QJ 030315 2006 Microsoft Corporation and CMP Media , LLC .\nAll rights reserved ;

D. 2000 .\nWar was always messy , expensive , and easily got out of any sort of control .\nBut successfully waged war can bring great benefits including ridding one of pesky potential attackers .\nWar was -- and to a surprising or , so Howard , perhaps not so surprising extent still is -- commonplace .\nPeace brings obvious benefits with it .\nThere is a lot to be said for the stability that peace allows -- including , but not limited to , the economic benefits of being able to better utilize limited resources rather than wasting them all on instruments of war .\nNevertheless , the idea of peace is a relatively new one .\nHoward suggests that if anyone could be said to have invented peace as more than a mere pious aspiration , it was Kant .\nAround the same time as this notion of peace began to spread wars also became more horrific .\nGenerally contained and limited before , the French revolution not only loosened the purse strings but released manpower on a scale that made it possible to field large armies .\nFollowing Napoleon there was a great incentive -- and an historic opportunity -- to achieve some sort of peace in Europe .\nThere was also a desire on the part of most of those involved to see to it that there was a balance of power that would help prevent further wars .\nThere were conflicting views as to how to go about this , as Howard describes , but a new order was established .\nIt made for a fairly successful peace , lasting near a century , with only a few European hiccoughs along the way .\nAfter that came , of course the Great War , followed closely by another war to end all wars .\nWith the end of the Cold War , where peace was held in the balance by the superpowers , it remains to be seen whether the current order promotes peace or ultimately pushes us to war again .\nThe world has changed , with one of the greatest changes being , as Howard notes , the erosion of the nation-state .\nSupranational entities and multinational firms wield increasing power .\nAnd Howard maintains that many states that have become nations since 1945 have not developed as nations at all -- in part because they never had to go through that essential rite of passage of fighting for independence .\nHoward suggests several threats to peace -- not the least of which is simple boredom .\nPeace is artificial , intricate and highly volatile , he reminds the reader , and the world does not seem up to entirely it .\nHoward s book has a decidedly western focus , a point he himself acknowledges .\nCertainly , the European and American wars of recent centuries have taken the greatest toll and had the most impact .\nNevertheless , especially at this time small , simmering regional conflicts seem the dominant forms of war from the former Yugoslavia to Chechnya to the myriad inter - African conflicts that is where peace is at its weakest .\nA bit more focus on this would have been of interest .\nThe Invention of Peace is a brief survey , covering a lot of material fairly quickly .\nHoward raises interesting points and he presents his arguments well , but one does wish for more exposition as can be found in some of his other works .\nIt may not be an age for peace , but apparently it is an age for concision ...\nStill , a worthwhile little book .\n- Return to top of the page - Links The Invention of Peace Profile Books publicity page Yale University Press publicity page Article in The Guardian Interview in Salon Reviews About.com Common Dreams Evening Standard Peace Matters taz German Die Welt German Die Zeit German - Return to top of the page - About the Author Sir Michael Eliot Howard was born in 1922 .\nHe taught at Oxford and at Yale and is the author of numerous books .\n- Return to top of the page - 2001-2003 the complete review Main | the New | the Best | the Rest | Review Index | Links\nThe Invention of Peace - Michael Howard\n',057

it should not be taken lighty for nothing in politics is what it seems .\nThoughts on Education and Campaign Finance By Michael Howard - Nov 6th , 2006 at 1 13 pm EST Also listed in Campaign Finance Reform | A Government for the People America as a nation and America as a people face great challenges in the years ahead .\nThose challenges , and the way in which they are handled , will determine not only our future but the future of the entire world .\nNever in the course of human history has there been a global force as powerful politically , socially and economically as the US is today .\nFor better or for worse many of the decisions made by the US government have global implications , implications that reach far beyond our borders , far beyond any Americans realm of experience and knowledge .\nFrom the fight against AIDs on the ground in Africa to the global war on terror to corrupt governments in less developed nations to the growing global environmental crisis that threatens civilizations as a whole , the actions and inactions of the US government are felt through out the world .\n\\*\\*\\* An Educated Population Leads to Good Government This is an awesome amount of power and the responsibility lies squarely at the feet of the American people .\nNo matter that few of us realize it , our government governs with our consent and we , by default , consent to the way in which it governs .\nThe actions of the US government should reflect the needs and views of the people and it is the responsibility of the people to be educated enough on the issues to recognize real needs and form intelligent views ; an informed population controls government , an uninformed population is controlled by government .\nThose of who look at history with a critical eye have seen it time and time again and those who look at current events see it happening now North Korea and China , with their state controlled media which attempts to suppress any news that might cast doubt on the motivations of their respective governments are prime examples of governments keeping the population uninformed in an effort to control that population .\nIt is the duty of every American to , at the very least , educate themselves on the more important issues facing the nation and world .\nIt is the duty of the government to provide the population with avenues to higher education An uneducated population benefits only an oppressive government .\nIt is for this reason that increases in education spending is absolutely necessary .\nImproved performance and opportunity at all levels of education , from preschool to graduate school , is vital to America s future and , by default , the future of the world .\nGreater educational opportunity for all Americans should be a clearly stated and aggressively pursued goal of our government .\nNot a talking point , not a hollow promise trumpeted more loudly as Election Day draws near , but an absolute national priority given full funding and the full attention of governing bodies at the local , state and national level .\nOur nation s education system is in crisis , and , again , by default , so is our nation s future and the future of the world as a whole .\n\\*\\*\\* Good Government Serves the Interests of the People The sooner the American population realizes that the fate of the world s population rests , while not entirely but certainly disproportionately , with us and our elected leaders , the sooner we will begin to take this into consideration when choosing our leaders .\nWe must ask ourselves Whose interests are being served in Washington DC ?\nIt is imperative that we , the people , see to it that it is our best interests being served ; that we are fairly , competently and honestly represented .\nNot the lobbyist and the interests that they represent , not corporations like Bechtel and Halliburton for whom the Iraq war has been an unimaginable windfall with the bill being handed to the American taxpayer an unfathomable source of revenue .\nThe influence of Wall Street must be removed from Washington DC .\nThe business community and the general public have competing interests , and what is good for one is not necessarily , perhaps even rarely , good for the other .\nPoliticians should not be businessmen , and businessmen should not be politicians .\nAmong the ideas upon which America was founded was the separation of church and state .\nThere was good reason for this ; historically the union of church and state resulted in diminished freedom , diminished rights and diminished opportunity for the general public .\nThe framers of our constitution were well aware of this fact ; however , had they known that the influence of the business community on government would have resulted in the current climate of corruption and greed in which the interests of the American people take a backseat to the personal financial gain of elected officials and their business partners , would they have included similar restrictions on business-government relationships ?\nAgain , the influence of Wall Street must be removed from Washington DC .\nThe method and manner in which campaigns are financed must be drastically altered and new standards of ethics must be imposed upon those that seek political office .\nWhen a corporation benefits from the actions of an elected official and then , in turn , that elected official benefits from the actions of that corporation the appearance of impropriety , if not the fact , are inescapable .\nThe business community and the government must be separated whenever and wherever they meet .\nThe opportunity for corruption , the allure of ill-gotten gains , is too great and human nature is too fallible to leave our government and our future to promises of good judgment and altruistic motives .\nWhen campaigns are financed by taxpayers , when each campaign is given an equal amount of financial resources and outside funds are prohibited then and only then will the interests of the people of this nation be served .\nIf this requires an amendment to the constitution to strip corporations of what they deemed to be their right of free speech , so be it .\nIf given the choice between a corporation s right to free speech and Americas right to a government that is free of corruption , a government that will serve the interests of its people I can only think of one group that would side with the corporations and that would be the corporations themselves .\nOur future , the future of our nation and , by default , the future of the world rests in the hands of our elected officials and being that it is our vote that elects those officials I ask you this question What is your responsibility ?\nMail to a Friend | Link | Comments 3 The \\* But \\* that is defining America By Michael Howard - Nov 2nd , 2006 at 5 46 pm EST Also listed in Campaign Finance Reform | A Government for the People I can always hear a \\* but \\* coming in a speech , in a news report , even in casual conversation .\nI can even hear the unspoken \\* but \\* s ; the implied \\* but \\* s. I can not believe that such a talent is genetic but my father was very much the same .\nI could not watch a movie with him , he always , without fail , knew the ending long before the plot began to wind down .\nHe was forever anticipating , forever futuring into the storyline .\nIn my experience he was never wrong .\nUnlike me , he was not overly political .\nHaving been born in 1933 , and raised in an era where the media was a completely and totally different beast .\nHe died during Clintons first term before the true nature of the beast was to be revealed .\nI wonder , though , if he saw that coming .\nI would like to think that he did .\nBut , I can always see a \\* but \\* coming , even when one is hiding and they often hide .\nFor Instance \\* The Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits corporations and labor organizations from using their general treasury funds to make contributions or expenditures in connection with federal elections .\nIn spite of this broad prohibition , there are many ways in which a corporation or labor union my legally participate in federal election activities .\n\\* So says the FECs Campaign Guide .\nThere is no \\* but \\* in there , but the \\* but \\* is clear as day .\nIf \\* In spite of \\* and \\* but \\* are not interchangeable in this instance stop reading now because the rest of this will not make any sense to you .\nAccording to dictionary.com my preference in linguistic reference material the phrase \\* in spite of \\* can be defined as \\* in disregard or defiance of ; notwithstanding \\* .\nRarely does one see a more accurate usage of a colloquialism then in the above legalese .\nThe \\* in spite of \\* above refers , of course , to SSFs separate segregated funds or , PACs .\nPolitical Action Committees are funny things and I am not sure that Mr. and Mrs. America really know what they are and what they do .\nThey are a product of the \\* but \\* hidden in the FECs opening statement as noted above .\nApparently corporations like Comcast , Verizon and AT T can not involve themselves in campaign finance , but the Comcast Political Action Committee , the AT T Inc. . Federal Political Action Committee and the Verizon Communication Inc Good Govt Club can .\nMaybe I am not as sophisticated as many of those that dwell in the Hall of Power but I would greatly appreciate some clarification on this because I am not seeing the distinction I consulted dictionary.com and wikipedia to no avail .\nI will lay that bit of confusion aside and reach for another .\nOne might think that a PAC would have a discernable political agenda .\nAs it turns out , believe it or not , this is not necessarily the case .\nIn an effort to ascertain an overt political agenda let us consider the three behemoths mentioned above and how they have exercised the FECs \\* but \\* .\nIn the 2005-2006 campaign cycle Comcasts PAC donated to a total of $ 757,665 to 207 congressional candidates ; 98 Democrats and 109 Republicans .\nAT Ts PAC donated a total of $ 1,268,533 to 299 candidates ; 115 Democrats and 184 Republicans .\nFinally , Verizons PAC donated a total of $ 851,050 for 297 candidates ; 122 Democrats and 175 Republicans .\nClearly neither Comcast , Verizon nor AT T recognize party lines .\nNow , I have always been under the assumption that party lines and politics go hand in hand .\nApparently the giants of the telecommunications industry are more interested in fair play then party lines .\nA level playing field in the game of politics ?\nAgain , I might not be as sophisticated as some , but I just can not believe that .\nIf that were the case why not just keep your money and build a park or two ?\nMaybe lower your service rates a few pennies .\nThe truth is that nobody spends a dime unless they think they are getting a dime ?\n? s worth of something in return preferably a quarters worth , but good luck with that one .\n.\nSo , obviously , Comcast , Verizon , AT T and all other PACs feel they are getting something for their money and that something is access .\nThey care nothing for party lines and therefore nothing about politics ; they care only about geographic lines , those lines that encompass Washington DC .\nWhile candidates are voted into office by the people they do not become candidates without financing .\nThe big picture indicates that big business picks the candidate and leaves the election in our hands .\nWe get to choose which one of their guys gets to the capitol .\nThe money matters more then the vote .\nWhat is my effort and my vote worth when faced with the millions of dollars that these corporate PACs can throw behind a hand picked candidate ?\nThis \\* American-style Democracy \\* has no future .\nIt is up to the party of the people to change this and it looks like the party of the people will wrest a measure of control away from the GOP in the coming weeks .\nDo we put it out of our misery now and work towards publicly funded campaigns or wait for a future generation to clean up the mess ?\nMail to a Friend | Link | Comments 1 Posts By Month 2006 January February March April May June July August September October November December Latest Posts Straight from the horse s mouth or possibly the other end by RDillon Whitfield Tough on Crime ? by RDillon Here we go againby RDillon Barack Obama Gaining On Clinton Now 28 \% to 23 \% by Dee Anna Roberts Poems of Protestby john R bennett Highest Rated Posts CALL TO ACTION UPDATE Revised by Dee Anna Roberts Presidential Candidate Barack Obama and the Cigarette Bull Sh ... ... . by Dee Anna Roberts Lethal Injection in the Newsby Hilary Carpenter Please Note ...
