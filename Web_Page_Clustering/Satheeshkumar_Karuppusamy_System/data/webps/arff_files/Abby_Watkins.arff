'WHS boys , Mac girls take titles By JOHN DEMPSEYTribune sportswriter Friday , May 14 , 2004 RUSSIAVILLE - A year after winning their first Mid - Indiana Conference Boys Track and Field Championship since the 1970s , the Western Panthers tightened their grip on the title Thursday night .\nCompeting on its home track , Western racked up 138 points , outdistancing the runners-up from Peru , who had 93 .\nWhile the Panthers and Bengal Tigers each won five events , the hosts won the meet on their depth as they scored two places in eight events .\nNorthwestern nipped Hamilton Heights , 77-76 , for third .\nEastern was fifth 60 and followed by Cass 38 , Taylor 14 and Maconaquah 4 .\nWe came out and scored twice in the pole vault , two in the high and intermediate hurdles .\nAdding things up before the meet , those were crucial places for us I felt , Panther coach Dana Neer said .\nWe were able to capitalize on that and that was important for us tonight .\nThis is a tribute to our seniors .\nWe haven t lost a meet on this track in the last three years .\nThat tribute begins with Kyle Walsh , who gained MIC titles in the 800 - and 1,600-meter runs by turning in season best times .\nJim Jackson joined him in scoring in the 1,600 and added a third in the 3,200 .\nKyle and Jim all of their careers have been able to get the job done , Neer said .\nThen there s Jonathan Brittain in the shot put and Noah Hoover .\nHe ran a solid 400 and then came out with the opening leg of the 1,600 relay .\nBrittain captured the shot put title and helped the Panthers to score well in the field events .\nBlayne Burkholder captured the pole vault while Blair Stellhorn came through with third and Brandon Youngdale took second in the high jump .\nTommy Jenkins garnered Western s other victory , taking first in the 100 dash and ran second to Peru s David Shaffer in the 200 .\nThis is ideal closure for the regular season .\nWe have the conference meet here .\nThere was a little pressure on the guys , but they came through , Neer said .\nThe Miami County Tigers performance was led by the four first-place finishes of Elliott Cohee .\nThe hurdler ran away from the field in both the 110 highs and 300 intermediates , winning the latter by more than three seconds .\nCohee ran the second leg of Peru s winning 400 relay and then took the baton for the final lap of the 1,600 relay and pulled his team to a nearly four-second victory .\nDespite finishing fifth , Eastern went home with three firsts as Ryan Kenworthy 400 dash and Jared Hill long jump claimed medals along with the Comets 3,200 relay of Brad Dean , Brent Hickman , Johnathon Fansler and Tony Martin .\nJay Young of Northwestern came through with the victory in the high jump while Aaron Smith did the same in the discus .\nBraves three-peat as MIC girls champs By JOHN DEMPSEYTribune sportswriter Friday , May 14 , 2004 RUSSIAVILLE - Excited by her own performance at Thursday s Mid - Indiana Conference Track and Field Meet , Krystol Hines was thrilled by that of her teammates after the Maconaquah Braves won their third consecutive conference crown .\nI m very , very excited about winning three years in a row .\nThe younger girls have really stepped up and are doing a wonderful job , the junior sprinter said after her team scored 124 points .\nThat was 40 points better than the runner-up Hamilton Heights Huskies .\nThe host Western Panthers were third with 78 with Taylor grabbing fourth at 50 .\nEastern 43 , Cass 37 , Northwestern 27 and Peru 25 rounded out the team finishes .\nHines ran away with the meet s top point performance as she claimed the first-place medal in the 100 - and 200-meter dashes , turned in the meet s top long jump and ran on the Braves winning 400 relay .\nHines felt there was room for improvement on her part .\nMy 200 time was good , but my 100 , I could have done better , but I was caught in the heat of the moment , she said .\nBut my team !\nThey made me feel great .\nKaty Howlett , she s my hero .\nShe tore it up on the 4-by-100 .\nKristine Hunt getting third in the 200 , that surprised me , but she really did well .\nMaconaquah coach Charlie Hubler noted the performances of his athletes up and down the line .\nThis was a 100 percent team victory and a team effort .\nWe got great , great performances in all 15 events , Hubler said .\nHe pointed to the 400 relay Hines , Howlett , Hunt and Amy Hausner that turned in a season best of 52.27 seconds .\nThose were great handoffs .\nThere were two or three others seeded right with us , but we did that with great handoffs , he said .\nKrystol just needs a step and she s off and gone .\nCoach Brent Wagoner and Dave Noonan have done a good job working on those .\nSenior Jocelyn Cook gave the team a pair of victories of her own as she captured her specialty -- the discus -- and also won the shot put .\nSavannah Sano came through with a first in the 400 dash .\nJocelyn gave that to the team and they gave right back to her , Hubler said .\nHe also noted the personal bests of the 1,600 relay that cut eight seconds and the 3,200 relay team as well as individuals Hannah Woods , Kristi Romine , Ashley Lehman .\nAlyssa Burkhardt was the top performer in the Heights camp as she won the 800 and ran on both the winning 1,600 and 3,200 relays .\nHeather Reeves also ran on both relays .\nWestern s Annina Gruber was the winner of the 1,600 run while teammate Kristi Irwin won the non-scoring pole vault .\nThe Comets Ann Bedwell claimed the 100 hurdles and took second behind Cass Abby Watkins in the 300s with a school record .\nTaylor s Dara Minglin claimed the high jump title .\n\n',099
'-RRB- -RRB- June - July 2004 World News The Machine Spanish climber Ram n Juli n Puigblanque , has been described by Steve Mc Clure as just a climbing machine , a block of muscle with technique thrown in unfairly .\nPuigblanque has spent this spring climbing on rock before his focus turns to the upcoming World Cup season and the world of plastic .\nHis performance should serve as a warning shot to his rivals .\nArriving in Siurana , Spain after a winter s training , the Spaniard quickly polished off two longstanding projects .\nPuigblanque warmed up by sending Chikane 5.14 c in six tries , a project bolted 20 years ago but which has repelled all previous attempts at redpoint .\nNext up was an old project of Dani Andrada , a line parallel to La Rambla .\nEstado Critico , a 40 m route with long moves on bad crimps gave Puigblanque a bit more trouble , requiring approximately 15 attempts for the redpoint .\nPuigblanque feels Estado Critico to be 5.14 d and the second hardest route in the area , just after his own La Rambla extension .\nSlab Technician Bain De Sang 5.14 d at St. Loup , Switzerland has been repeated by Italian Alessandro Lamberti .\nAccording to Lamberti , the near-vertical route with very technical climbing and a boulder problem crux at the top required much more fine tuning and co-ordination , it has to be climbed much more serenely and with less rage , an approach in marked contrast to other high end steep sport routes he has done .\nLamberti is unsure of the grade of Bain De Sang , but feels that the V10 boulder crux which arrives at the end combined with the lack of fast repeats , pushes Bain De Sang beyond the realm of 5.14 c.\nV15 Trade Route In the three years since Fred Nicole s Dream Time V15 at Cresciano was established , the problem has gone from being the world s most difficult to a journeyman problem , albeit a journeyman problem for the world s elite .\nThis spring saw ascents by Italian Mauro Calibani and American James Litz .\nAmid all the ascents come charges of chipping and manipulation from none other then Fred Nicole .\nNicole states that Cresciano and Dreamtime in particular has fallen victim to over-enthusiastic cleaning with steel brushes , and said some must have used more than a brush .\nHowever , Malcolm Smith , a recent ascensionist , has countered that he has tried this problem on a number of occasions since its first ascent and I think if there are changes then they must be very subtle indeed .\nI have not noticed a marked difference in the size of the holds or the difficulty of the problem .\nSmith also stated that , I think that what can happen over years and after thousands of brushings and hands is that the holds can change organically .\nMc Clure Becomes Grit s Elder Statesman Briton Steve Mc Clure , best known for his cutting edge sport routes , has turned his attention toward gritstone and its associated traditional ethos .\nThe result is Elder Statesman , the ar te to the left of Elder Crack , a longstanding last great line that has rebuffed the efforts of many of Britain s best climbers .\nThe line starts via the original crack and launches out on to the ar te at three quarter height .\nMc Clure gains an edge near the corner via a heel toe cam in the crack , putting him in a fully horizontal position , before launching out around the corner in a violent swing to latch a bad hold on the face and easier ground .\nMc Clure hesitates to assign a grade citing his inexperience with gritstone grades , but the route is likely to be at least E7 which translated to a 5.13 or harder trad line .\n5.14 b Onsight ?\nSpanish climber Patxi Usobiaga has shown he is in fine onsighting form for the upcoming season with a week-long spree in Alquezar and Laroanna , Spain .\nUsobiaga kicked things off with an onsight of B12 rated at 5.14 a\\/b and Desafiendo Newton 5.14 a.\nThen proceeded to link Desafiendo Newton with Tsunami 5.14 b a route he had done previously .\nImpressively , Usobiaga completed the linkage on his first attempt , to produce Desafiendo Tsunami 5.14 c\\/d .\nIf the rating of B12 eventually settles at 5.14 b , it will stand as the first 5.14 b onsight .\n_ Andre Cheuk return to top News Smith Rocks Trad Redux Torontonian Sonnie Trotter recently tested his personal limits on the run out Smith Rock classic East Face 5.13 c\\/d FA Alan Watts , 1985 .\nThe route follows a 44m-crack line and has five bolts , a belay station and one fixed piton for protection .\nAccording to the Smith guide book , the route still awaited its first true redpoint almost 20 years after the first ascent .\nTrotter , stoked on trad climbs as of late , intended to clean the route without clipping any fixed gear .\nBecause the route has meager protection and requires a mandatory runout section at the crux , it s rarely attempted .\nMy first attempt on lead I took a sweet 40-footer , described Trotter .\nIt was awesome but a heartbreaker .\nI had only two more moves to go .\nI found it very difficult to place protection while right in the middle of the cruxy bulging sections .\nIt took Trotter seven days over two weeks before he put the sequence together .\nIn mid - April , he sent the route .\nIt was positively one of my most rewarding climbing moments .\nIt was for sure a huge step above You Must Be High in Eldo .\nReferring to a 5.13 c\\/d R \\/ X route he recently climbed .\nDiscussing his revamped fervor for trad climbing , Totter claimed that he looks forward to trying other desperately hard climbs on clean gear .\nIt just feels right to do things this way .\nFestiglace The North Face du Qu bec On February 20th to 22nd , the seventh annual Festiglace The North Face du Qu bec was held in Pont - Rouge .\nThe ice climbing took place in the Ile de Raisin Canyon , a spot considered by many to be among the top five ice destinations in the world .\nThe competition featured top climbers Guy Lacelle , Will Gadd and Abby Watkins in the team , speed and mixed events .\nThis year s Festiglace drew an excellent turnout from both competitors and spectators .\nEvening entertainment included slide shows by Gadd , Sean Isaac and J r me Blanc - Gras .\nThe Adidas amateur speed-climbing event was a spectator favorite , featuring top rock climbers like Nick Sagar trying their hand in this icy medium .\nGadd , St phane Lapointe and J r me Blancgras were the top three respectively in the men s speed competition while Abby Watkins , Audrey Gari py and Myriam St - Louis finished one , two , three in the women s event .\n_ Chris Lepik Rockies Mixed Euro Onslaught With the cancellation of this winter s Ice World Cup many of Europe s top mixed climbers made the journey across the Atlantic to attend the Canmore Ice Climbing Festival and Kayland Cup Competition as well as sample the Canadian Rockies renowned mixed testpieces .\nAs one local sarcastically pointed out , The Cineplex was the Ice World Cup this year .\nThe main action was centred on Ben Firth s latest creation , The Game M13 , now heralded as the toughest in the world .\nFirst on the scene was Harry Berger Austria who made a semi-repeat of The Game by doing the first roof crux then unknowingly finished up on the last half of the parallel Rocky Mountain Horror Show M11 + instead of its proper finish which is slightly harder .\nIsrael Blanco Spain made the true second ascent .\nHe overcame the crux dyno with cunning by leaving his heel-spur hooked on the tool he launched from in order to make the span .\nHe then proceeded to release his lower tool with his feet and bring it up to his hand , while dangling by one tool .\nMauro Bubu Bole Italy made the third ascent but being much shorter than the giant Firth , he had to add 10 cm extensions to his axes to make the crux reach .\nRegarding these tactics , Firth quips , It s all part of the game .\nEvgeny Kirovshetsev Ukraine went on to make a fourth repeat .\nMixed climbing is evolving at such a breakneck pace that routes like Musashi , originally M12 and only a year ago considered the hardest in the world , saw stacks of ascents .\nThis 25 m horizontal challenge saw over 10 repeats including its first flash by Blanco and first female ascent by Anna Toretta Italy .\nOther European uber-climbers also made rapid repeats including Kurt Astner Italy , Herbert , Bole , Kirovshetsev , Chris Cubbet England , Ines Papert Germany and Scott Muir Scotland .\nRocky Mountain Horror Show originally M11 + , beside Musashi also saw a flurry of traffic .\nThe crux slot has widened , creating a very technical torque and making it substantially harder than when originally climbed .\nIt saw redpoints by Kirovshetsev and Roger Strong of the USA as well as an onsight ascent by Bole , becoming the hardest onsight of a mixed route to date .\nOn the local front , Sean Isaac of Canmore sent both Rocky Mountain Horror Show and Musashi .\nAlong with Isaac , Kirovshetsev and Bole are the only other two people this year to repeat both .\nAll three believe that RHMS is definitely the harder of the two .\nMusashi has gotten easier with traffic the holds are more positive from picks digging in while RMHS has become harder .\nHaving repeated these two testpieces , Isaac believes that his and Dave Thomson s 2001 Stanley Headwall route , Phyllis Diller originally graded M10 and unrepeated , is in retrospect much harder and probably closer to M11 when compared to the Cineplex routes .\nIn the Hoar House Cave at the back of Haffner Creek , Joe Buszowski established Neolithic M11 , besides Isaac s roof-and-log contrivance Caveman M10 .\nLike its neighbor , Neolithic has absolutely no ice but makes up for this with difficulty .\nBerger made the second ascent in four tries confirming the grade .\nNow in his mid-40s , Buszowski is in his mixed climbing prime .\nHe has witnessed the evolution of the sport since his first ascent of the classic Mixed Master with Troy Kirwan in 1991 .\nCaveman also received its first flash ascent by Calgary strongman , Mike Charbonneau .\nBesides the hard sends by visiting climbers , local activists have been hard at work establishing more mixed classics .\nThe second edition of Mixed Climbs in the Canadian Rockies came out in January and there are already over 30 new routes , many of which are of the traditionally protected variety .\n_ Sean Isaac North Face of The North Twin Climbed Again Steve House and Marko Prezelj recently made the coveted third ascent up the north face of The North Twin .\nTheir mixed route sits between the two now infamous routes on the Twin , the unrepeated Lowe \\/ Jones 1974 and Blanchard \\/ Cheesmond routes 1985 .\nThe ascent is the third time in 30 years the North Twin has been climbed successfully .\nIn spite of a minor catastrophe during their third bivy in which House managed to drop his outer right boot , the twosome worked their way up the 1371 m headwall .\nHouse was forced to second with a single boot but managed to attach his right crampon to his inner liner .\nPrezelj led the final 10 pitches before the duo were forced to bivi just shy of the summit on April 7th .\n_ Mark Cohen Drytoolers Blitz Rockies Alpine Between February 19-21 , Ben Firth and Raphael Slawinski made the first winter ascent of the Greenwood - Locke route on the north face of Mt Temple V 5.8 A2 in the summer , 1200 m M6 in the winter .\nOn day one , the duo skied in , soloed up the Dolphin couloir then climbed five rope lengths on the headwall before pitching their Bibler over a snow flute .\nFirth and Slawinski freed the remaining six pitches of drytooling on day two .\nAccording to Slawinski , the route had seen 10 previous winter attempts , none of them successful .\nSean Dougherty , Jeff Marshall , Chris Geisler and the late Guy Edwards all attempted the route - Dougherty himself put in four separate attempts .\nAs for our climb , said Slawinski , the difference between it and the previous attempts and perhaps also what tipped the scales in our favor was our extensive drytooling experience , both on bolted mixed climbs and on more traditional routes .\nWe drytooled the difficult section of the route for no other reason than it was the easiest and fastest way to go about things .\nA month later , Slawinski returned to Temple with Russian Valery Babinov who recently immigrated to Canada to climb The Sphinx Face V 5.9 A2 , a route first done in 1988 by Ward Robinson and Rob Orvig .\nSlawinski and Babinov climbed the route and drytooled their way through the route s difficult M6 sections .\nUnfortunately , they were forced to descend shy of the summit because of deteriorating conditions .\nThe Greenwood - Locke route , first climbed in 1966 , is considered a Rockies alpine classic .\nThe route offers the least hazardous , most technical climbing on the north face of Temple .\nIt sits to the right of the easier but slightly more committing 1974 Elzinga - Miller summer route that s seen a minimum of three winter ascents .\n_ Mark Cohen return to top Got News ?\nDid you redpoint your first 5.11 ?\nor finally nail that V6 ?\nWe

C. Berkeley in 1988 .\nShe is the recipient of the Mask and Dagger Prize for extraordinary contributions to Dramatic Art dance and she regularly publishes articles in climbing publications in the U. S. , Australia , and Europe .\nAbby s also an animal lover ; she saved the life of a dog that fell of the top of a cliff where she was climbing .\nShe has been working in the outdoors for 12 years .\nIn Her Own Words The Job As a mountain guide , my job is varied and full .\nI am currently making my way through the ACMG mountain guide s exams , which entails 5 exams over about 5 years and will cost a total of about $ 20,000 to become a fully certified mountain guide .\nThis summer , I will be both guiding and practicing my guiding skills in order to pass the guide s exam .\nThis means getting into the alpine as much as possible , even if the weather is not as good as it could be .\nFor example , yesterday my husband and I climbed the northeast Ridge of Mt.\nAthabasca in the Canadian Rockies in a white out .\nI led the day as if I was guiding while Rich acted as my client and examiner .\nRich is a fully certified UIAGM guide who examines for the ACMG .\nI enjoyed the challenge of route finding with no visibility it s good to put yourself into situations like that , so that you can be calm and practiced when such situations present themselves spontaneously .\nI will also be guiding private clients this summer on multi-pitch rock routes and mountaineering .\nI am putting together a women s rock clinic through Ascending Women , which entails gathering a great group of guides .\nSome of the most accomplished and highly certified women guides in Canada have agreed to be a part of it .\nPutting together clinics takes quite a bit of organization , so that they run smoothly when the day comes .\nBecause I mostly work for myself , I need to be highly motivated , creative , and organized in order to keep the business going , but I also enjoy the freedom and variation I can bring to my life and work , so it s worth it .\nHow She Got There I started climbing while I was at university at U. C. Berkeley .\nI began to work at Cal Adventures , U. C. Berkeley s outdoor adventure department , a year after I started climbing .\nThis brought some institutional knowledge to my fledgling skills and really put me on the right track technically .\nSince then I have worked for many outdoor companies , guide services , and climbing gyms .\nI ve also created my own work within those frameworks traveling with a climbing technique clinic , private climbing coaching , writing operation manuals , and training staff in newly opened climbing gyms , etc. .\nI did not take intellectual steps , so to speak , to get where I am now .\nI simply followed my love of the mountains and the outdoors .\nThe work followed .\nThe years I put into climbing , simply because that was what I loved and wanted to do , have paid off in the mountain knowledge and skills I have now .\nHow to Get Her Job To become a mountain guide , one must first develop mountain sense , which only comes from climbing and skiing in the mountains for many years , in many different mountain ranges .\nOnly then can you approach the guide s exams .\nI am enjoying the process of certification because it really makes me focus on my skills and knowledge .\nI also love learning from mountain guides who have been guiding for 20 or 30 years you can t buy that kind of experience .\nYou have to love people to be a mountain guide , or any kind of guide .\nA guide must be able to interpret the medium they are intimate with in such a way that the clients feel like they are a part of the process , not a lump on the end of the rope .\nThe mountain guide must be interested in people from all walks of life , and in sharing full and often tiring days with all kinds of folk .\nGuides have endless patience and love to see people discover their capabilities and to achieve things they thought they couldn t. Guides also must explain to the clients the difference between safe conditions and the kind of conditions where you have to turn around .\nPros Being outside in all elements ; meeting people from all over the world .\nCons Long stints away from home can be stressful on relationships but can also be good if there is a balance some time away but lots of time together .\nSalary Range Fully certified mountain guides in Canada make $ 300-500 per day , depending on what they are guiding and if they are guiding for themselves or contracting for a company although in the States , one must be an employee of a company in order to guide under the current rules , which makes the pay lower and the variety of what you are guiding diminish .\nHer Dream Job Doing what I m doing .\nDo you think there s any danger in your passion becoming your career ?\nAs long as you keep variety in what you are guiding easy in Canada where the seasons affect what you are guiding from rock to alpine to ice to ski touring .\nAlso , guiding independently possible in UIAGM countries such as Canada allows you to keep variety in what you are guiding .\nI also like to keep other ways of earning money alongside what I do , like writing , studying biology , teaching dance , and practicing yoga .\nReturn to Top RELATED GORP LINKS GORP Jobs GORP Commmunity GORPtravel TOP TRIPS US Asia Canada Mexico Cen America S.

C. -- More than seven people would have certainly died in a weekend avalanche if not for her rescue efforts , but Abby Watkins says she s no hero .\nThe victims were in the worst possible situation at the worst time and we were in the best position to stage a rescue , the 33-year-old assistant alpine guide said yesterday from her home here .\nAnybody would have done the same thing .\nWatkins and her husband Rich Marshall were skiing just above a group of 17 Strathcona - Tweedsmuir school students , two teachers and an adult chaperone near Rogers Pass Saturday morning when the pair saw the avalanche begin .\nDespite the couple s warning shouts , all 17 were hit by the fast-moving wall of snow .\nThere was nothing they could do but brace themselves , Watkins recalled .\nIt was very fast-moving and when it hit the kids it carried them for 10 or 20 metres before it stopped .\nAs soon as the killer wave of snow came to rest , Watkins and her husband skied about 100 metres through the trees to reach the buried group .\nAll they could see was a single arm reaching through the snow .\nThey freed that person -- an adult chaperone with a satellite phone that was used to call park wardens for help .\nWatkins -- who has training in such rescues but was never pressed to use her skills until Saturday morning -- and her husband , turned their avalanche beacons from send to receive mode and started digging down to the rest of the group .\nAs one person was freed they , too , would start digging through the snow searching for their peers .\nThe teens , although shaken by the twist of events that turned a pleasant field trip into an unthinkable nightmare , almost immediately pitched in with little urging from Marshall and Watkins .\nThey wanted to do something , Watkins said .\nThey tirelessly dug through the compacted snow while Watkins and her husband talked to the traumatized teens , assuring them help was close at hand .\nBy the time the organized rescue party arrived , all but two had been accounted for .\nI was thinking a lot but I was mostly on autopilot , Watkins said .\nShe credits her husband for keeping her focused .\nWatkins said some of the survivors parents have thanked her but she has not dealt emotionally with the weekend s events .\nWe didn t sleep too well last night , she said , adding she may want to talk to someone later .\nParks Canada has counsellors at the ready .\n-RRB- Here s the pitch There s been widespread rejoicing that the federal government is considering a national don t call list that would offer relief from these pesky telephone pitches .\nFull Column Columnist ROY CLANCY Canada World Witness taped Hells Angels U.

C. -- Seven teens on a high-school ski excursion in the treacherous back country of east-central B. C. died Saturday when a half-kilometre-wide avalanche roared down from a mountainside and engulfed their group .\nIt was the second deadly slide to hit the region in as many weeks .\nSeven adults perished in a slide in January .\nThe dead were six boys and one girl , all in Grade 10 at Strathcona - Tweedsmuir School , a private day school on an expansive rural campus in the foothills southwest of Calgary .\nThe surviving students , the two teachers and parent chaperone were expected back in Calgary late Sunday night .\nSix of the students have some scrapes and bruises , and one male suffered a broken ankle .\nWe are absolutely stricken with grief .\nOur hearts go out to all those who are impacted , Tony Macoun , head of the school , said in a written statement .\nFrantic parents gathered at the school Saturday night , arriving separately and in groups , embracing each other .\nNo students were visible .\nOur school is a small family and loss this extreme is impacting us tremendously , said Macoun .\nThere were 17 people in the school group , three adults and 14 Grade 10 students in an outdoor education class , on their annual cross-country ski trip .\nThe avalanche occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon , said Pam Doyle , superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke .\nIt happened on the north face of the mountain in Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley , about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit .\nThe group was led by two male teachers and a male volunteer .\nAll had certification and back-country experience , Macoun said .\nThe group had been skiing about 15 metres apart , with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear .\nThe skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope , burying nearly the entire group .\nAnother group of young skiers witnessed the avalanche and were among the first to help .\nA supervisor whose hand was just visible above the snow was the first to be dug out .\nOnce freed , he called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm .\nOf the remaining students , six of the students are safe and one has a broken ankle , Macoun said in his statement .\nThe three leaders were uninjured and are attending to the survivors , who were in Revelstoke on Saturday night after being airlifted first to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter .\nTwo people from the group were treated for minor injuries , said RCMP Sgt.\nRandy Brown .\nThe avalanche was very powerful , with a rating from 3 to 3.5 , compared with a top rating of 4 , said Pat Dunn , a Parks Canada spokeswoman .\nThe size 3 to 3.5 avalanche could destroy a building .\n.\n.\nor 10 acres of forest , she said .\nThe slide was 500 to 800 metres wide and traveled a kilometre down the slope .\nSome of the skiers were buried as deep as three metres , said Dunn .\nShe said the group was carrying the proper avalanche-rescue equipment , including personal locator beacons and digging tools .\nA park conditions bulletin said there was a considerable avalanche hazard in the area Saturday .\nThat rating is about the middle of the hazard scale but includes the high probability that a person could trigger a slide , said Dunn .\nThe risk always varies .\n.\n.\nwhen the risk is posted as considerable it s a note to skiers to be cautious , she said .\nThere are a couple of instabilities in our snow pack this winter .\n.\n.\nthat may have contributed and further investigation will determine that .\nSaturday s slide was unusually deadly , said Eric Dafoe , public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke .\nWe ve never had an avalanche like this where we had a multiple number of people buried , said Dafoe , who worked on the rescue effort and flew over the slide as part the initial investigation .\nIt was a huge slide , he said .\nIt covered the valley floor from side to side .\nDafoe said the slide began at a point between 2,200 to 2,300 vertical metres up Mount Cheops .\nIt traveled for a kilometre and spread out half a kilometre at the sides .\nThe toe of the slide ended at about the 1,500-metre elevation mark with parts of it more than five metres deep .\nDafoe said the investigation will continue but was almost certain it was a natural slide .\nIt the slide trigger site is so far from the bottom it seems unlikely it was human-triggered , he said .\nDafoe speculated a small slide may have occurred high up the mountain and as it came down , it dragged out snow from surrounding gullies .\nPark wardens , RCMP officers and local ski tour operators and guides , backed up by four or five helicopters and search dogs , joined in the rescue effort .\nMembers of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche-control work were also on hand to assist .\nIt was the second major slide in the area in a month .\nSeven people in a party of 21 back-country skiers died in a much smaller avalanche Jan. 20 on Durrand Glacier , located about 30 kilometres east of Saturday s slide .\nA memorial service for the victims was held just Friday in a Revelstoke church .\nRuedi Beglinger , owner of Selkirk Mountain Experience and organizer of the fatal expedition last month , was with his clients when it struck .\nContacted Saturday night , Beglinger did not want to comment on the level of experience necessary to ski the area where the students were caught .\nThere is an inherent risk in back-country skiing which is very important to talk about , an inherent risk people have to be willing to share amongst themselves whether they have a guide or not , he said .\nThe area of Saturday s slide is not particularly remote , but Dunn said there were no groomed trails , except people who have been there before you .\nBut no guides are needed to ski in the area and skiers do not have to register before setting off .\nIt s a very , very popular ski destination site , said Dunn , media liaison officer at the national park .\nBrown said the skiers were not part of a commercial tour group .\nDoyle said that at this time there are no plans yet to close back-country areas of the park .\nUPDATE REVELSTOKE , B. C. CP - Authorities said Sunday it was time to take another look at the safety of back-country skiing in an area where a day earlier seven Calgary-area teens were swept to their deaths in a massive avalanche .\nSix boys and one girl were killed Saturday while skiing with a high-school group on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park , about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit in east-central British Columbia .\nB. C. Premier Gordon Campbell said Sunday he wanted his government to work with federal officials and professional associations on a comprehensive review of safety in such wilderness expanses .\nObviously , all of us have to work together on this , said Campbell , who did not specify the scope he thought a review should take , or what role he thought the provincial government should assume .\nNone of us want this to happen to anyone who is enjoying our parks and our wilderness .\nCampbell offered few details on what changes might be proposed , saying it was important to wait and get all the information that we ... need , to make sure the steps we take are steps that will move us down the right road .\nMeanwhile , a Parks Canada official with the federal department s local avalanche control section said the current system for providing risk bulletins to back-country skiers in the park would be re-evaluated .\nDavid Skjonsberg said the area where the teens died is under Parks Canada jurisdiction but the department doesn t carry out any avalanche control for back-country areas of the park .\nHis office provides daily avalanche risk bulletins but there is an expectation that the user make their own decision in terms of destinations , trip procedures and the type of equipment .\nSkjonsberg said the avalanche warning system would be re-evaluated but thought it was unlikely we re going to see any major changes in our approach .\nWe believe we re providing a good quality product for back-country users , he said .\nBut perhaps there s something we re missing in how we convey the information to users so they really fully understand our definition of the danger ratings , for instance , and what the potential consequences of that danger rating might be .\nHe was hesitant to say whether the group composed of 14 students and three adult supervisors should have been skiing in the area at the time they were hit .\nAt any time if you travel in mountains , there is always a risk , he said .\nThe probability of an avalanche is never zero .\nClair Israelson , director of the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke , said Sunday it was time that B. C. and Alberta and Canada seriously address the avalanche safety issue in Western Canada .\nHe recommended that a coalition of industry , government and private sector workers work together to promote better warning systems .\nSkjonsberg said he didn t foresee the long-term closure of the area where the avalanche occurred .\nThe area was reopened by Sunday night after being temporarily closed for investigators .\nIf I was to close that area , I m afraid I d have to be looking at virtually closing off the back-country of the park and I really don t feel that s warranted , he said .\nI think people can travel safely in the mountains .\nThe high-school group was hit just before noon by a massive slide that swept through the Connaught Creek Valley on Mount Cheops .\nThe group included 14 students and three adult supervisors .\nThe tragedy was only about 30 kilometres away from the site of a smaller slide two weeks earlier that killed seven adult back-country skiers .\nThat avalanche was termed a fluke of nature by one survivor and authorities said there was no evidence it was caused by the skiers themselves .\nSaturday s slide traveled through the valley and into the shoulder where the party was climbing the valley , said Eric Dafoe , a public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke .\nIt was about 500 metres wide and officials said it was capable of destroying a building .\nTwo nearby mountain guides witnessed the slide and had just managed to shout a warning when the slide hit .\nDafoe said the skiers had somewhere between four and five seconds before being swept away .\nThe two guides rushed over and managed to dig out a supervisor whose hand was just visible through the snow .\nThat supervisor immediately called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm .\nA rescue party was on scene within 40 minutes , but Dafoe said the students and supervisors initially rescued by the guides had already begun work on digging out their fellow skiers .\nPeople were searching the snow , digging , he said .\nAs many as 35 people managed to get to the site to help with the rescue , said Dafoe .\nAll but three people had been pulled out within 40 minutes .\nIt was a huge co-operative effort , he said .\nIt occurred very rapidly .\nThe group s three adult supervisors and remaining seven students escaped with minor injuries .\nThose who died were asphyxiated , coroner Chuck Purse said Sunday .\nRed-eyed teenagers and their parents began arriving early Sunday at Strathcona - Tweedsmuir School , a private school on an expansive campus in the foothills southwest of Calgary .\nA team of grief counsellors began working with about 300 members of the shell-shocked school community .\nPrincipal Glenn Odland said Sunday a third-party investigation would conduct an inquiry into the preparation that went into the trip , but said the three adult supervisors were well-prepared and had extensive training .\nThe avalanche risk for the alpine area above the students was classified as considerable by Skjonsberg s office that day , but the risk was only moderate in the treeline area where the students were skiing .\nBut the avalanche traveled a kilometre , engulfing the teenagers and their supervisors .\nUPDATE David Heyman Calgary Herald Monday , February 03 , 2003 Skiers from Strathcona - Tweedsmuir High School had four or five seconds to react to a massive slide of snow powerful enough to take out buildings .\nThe slide was so large it contained at least 1,000 tonnes of snow , according to information provided by the Canadian Avalanche Association .\nIt was huge , said Eric Dafoe , public safety co-ordinator for Glacier National Park , who was on the scene shortly after the avalanche occurred .\nHe rated the slide as a three or 3.5 on a scale of five .\nAt that level , an avalanche can bury and destroy a car or small building and snap trees .\nAn avalanche rated as one is relatively harmless to people , whereas an avalanche rated as five could destroy a village or a forest .\nDafoe added the skiers would have had no time to get out of the avalanche s path .\nHe said the slide fractured the snowpack at a depth of between 80 and 150 centimetres .\nIt swept about a kilometre downhill and was about 500 to 800 metres wide , barrelling down the hill towards the 17 skiers .\nSeven of the skiers died and all were Grade 10 students at the Okotoks-area school .\nThe survivors included seven students , one parent chaperone and two teachers .\nThe seeds of Saturday s avalanche were sown last November when a particularly unstable layer of snow was created at the beginning of a very unusual season .\nThis layer has created problems throughout the season , but on Saturday , the instability turned into a massive avalanche .\nLast month , another avalanche swept down nearby Durrand Glacier , burying a group of backcountry skiers .\nOf the 13 people buried in that avalanche , seven people died .\nDave Skjonsberg , manager of the avalanche control section of Parks Canada , said Saturday s slide started well above the treeline where the avalanche risk was rated considerable but swept into the areas below where the risk was rated moderate .\nAlthough technically you could say they were at treeline , the avalanche did not start at treeline , he said .\nThe avalanche initiated in the alpine .\nIt progressed below the treeline , and the results were tragic .\nHe said the area around Revelstoke has had one of the most unusual snow seasons in the past 30 years and that s created very unstable sections in the snowpack , especially areas laid down in November , upon which newer snow has rested .\nAn investigation has been launched into the cause of this avalanche .\nIt started small at around 11 40 a.m. Saturday , high above the treeline on the west shoulder of the north face of Mount Cheops , about three kilometres from the Trans - Canada Highway .\nIt was first spotted by two backcountry skiers from Golden , who were relaxing on the opposite side of the Connaught Valley .\nThey had just passed the group of 14 students and three guides from Strathcona - Tweedsmuir School and knew , to their horror , they were in immediate peril .\nRCMP say one man shouted Avalanche , avalanche , avalanche , but it was already too late .\nThe small slide quickly dug into much deeper snow further down , pulling with it hundreds of tonnes of snow .\nThe entire mass quickly accelerated down the mountain in a plume of mist and debris .\nSuch was its speed and force that it swept around a corner , part way up another mountain before flushing down the Balu Pass Trail where the students were , burying all 17 skiers .\nClair Israelson , managing director of the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke , said the avalanche moved extremely quickly .\nThe people involved had very little chance to do anything prior to being hit by the snow .\nThis was a large avalanche .\nThis would have been big enough to destroy your home or a train .\nUPDATE REVELSTOKE , B. C. -- Avalanche , avalanche , avalanche !!\nA shout from a fellow skier was the only warning a group of 14 students and three adults from the Calgary area had on Saturday .\nFive seconds later , a huge wall of snow crashed down on the skiers , burying some as deep as four metres .\nA frantic rescue attempt followed , with survivors making heroic efforts to save their classmates .\nPeople pulled from the snow immediately dug out others still below .\nOne student brushed the snow from a classmate s mouth and tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation .\nIn the end , seven teenagers -- six boys and a girl -- died .\nTheir day had started routinely .\nThe students and their instructors from Strathcona - Tweedsmuir School near Calgary set out early Saturday on the annual Grade 10 backcountry ski trip to Glacier National Park , west of Banff .\nOvernight snowfall had added to the light-but-steady accumulation on the mountains around Rogers Pass .\nThe temperature was around 0 .\nWarm southwesterly winds blew across their trail as they left the parking lot at Connaught Creek .\nParks Canada had warned that avalanches were possible in the higher alpine areas but were unlikely below the tree line , where the group was skiing .\nJust before noon , the avalanche started as a small snow slide , high on Cheops Mountain .\nIt grew steadily as it barrelled down .\nIt was a rolling wall of snow one kilometre long and 500 to 800 metres wide by the time it thundered into the valley and pushed up the far side with enough force to wipe out a building .\nA skier near the school group saw the slide and screamed avalanche three times as the group moved along a trail , about three kilometres from the parking lot , not far above the valley floor .\nFive seconds later , the group was under snow -- some four metres down .\nThe 10 survivors were saved by the intensive efforts of a rescue team of 35 people , including Armed Forces personnel .\nSergeant Randy Brown of the Revelstoke RCMP detachment said two experienced backcountry skiers saw the avalanche and realized a group of skiers was caught in it .\nThe rescue team , which arrived at the scene 45 minutes after receiving the call for help , included seven helicopters , local ski guides , six avalanche search dogs , park wardens , ski patrols and members of the Forces who normally deal with avalanche control at Rogers Pass .\nIt took one hour and 20 minutes to find the entire group .\nCoroner Chuck Purse said the seven students died of asphyxiation .\nAfter reviewing reports by the RCMP and a consultant , he will decide whether to hold an inquest into the backcountry deaths .\nDave Skjonsberg , manager of Parks Canada s avalanche-control section in Revelstoke , said the region s weather was highly unusual .\nThe mountains have had little snow .\nIt is one of the most unusual winters in 30 years .\nSurvivors were airlifted out of the park and brought to Revelstoke , about 65 kilometres west of Glacier National Park .\nWith swollen , red eyes , the parents -- along with the survivors siblings -- accompanied the children yesterday .\nSome of the students , with bruises on their faces , could be seen boarding a bus .\nOne student has a serious leg injury .\nSeveral family members , appearing stunned , declined comment .\nThe deaths come two weeks after an avalanche killed seven skiers in the same region of British Columbia .\nThis winter , 16 people have died in B. C. avalanches .\nAn average of 13 people die in Canadian avalanches annually .\nParks Canada , the B. C. Coroner s Office , the RCMP and the school announced investigations to discover what had happened and whether anyone could have done anything differently .\nSchool principal Glenn Odland said the skiers were highly skilled and well-equipped .\nThe group leader was a certified backcountry guide , and the other adults were trained and experienced , he said .\nThe elite private school , about 20 minutes south of Calgary , offers six trips a year for students to experience the backcountry .\nUPDATE By the time they wake Saturday morning , Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers .\nIn tree-line and alpine areas , the avalanche risk has been assessed as considerable , the mid-range of the five possible ratings .\nBelow the tree line , the risk is assessed as moderate , with natural avalanches unlikely .\nAnd the STS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemark expedition to Balu Pass .\nBut the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize .\nThere were similar references for the same mountain range in avalanche bulletins last month , just before the deadly slide that claimed seven lives near Revelstoke , B. C. The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building , a macaroni-shaped structure with a sod and timber roof , to pore over the latest information .\nMr. Nicholson goes inside .\nHe asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher and a chaperone .\nThe group decides it is safe to ski that day .\nBy 10 15 a.m. , they are on the trailhead to the pass , five kilometres away , described by backcountry enthusiasts as an easy , but beautiful trail .\nThey ski through forest , along a rocky creek , over a snow-covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley .\nSurrounded by mountains and deep powder snow , the scenery is breathtaking .\nReminders of past avalanches are everywhere .\nRelentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over the years have littered the area with rocks and stumps .\nFoliage is sparse on the valley floor .\nThe school group successfully crosses four avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley , and three on the south side .\nThey note that the debris from one avalanche path across the valley is no more than a week old .\nThey are halfway to their destination .\n\\*\\*\\* It s a soft , gray morning .\nThe ground is blanketed by eight centimetres of fresh snow .\nThe temperature hovers around zero .\nThe past 24 hours have been avalanche-free , and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia .\nThey are not alone .\nThe mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass .\nHusband and wife pause to say hello .\nIt s a beautiful day out here , isn t it ?\nsays Abby .\nYes , someone responds .\nThey leave the 14 teenagers and three adults behind , climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area .\nAbby looks back at the people below and a gangly teen , all arms and legs , catches her eye .\nAren t kids funny ?\nLook at that kid , she tells Rich .\nAt that very moment , just before noon on Saturday , something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain .\nAbby and Rich hear a thunderous roar .\nThey watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley , picking up speed and debris .\nThe school group is directly in its path .\nRich screams Avalanche !\nAvalanche !\nAvalanche !\nThe skiers look up .\nThe guide s frantic warning comes too late .\nThe avalanche hits them head on .\nIn a matter of seconds , all 17 skiers are swept away in a huge , terrifying tangle of snow , rocks and trees .\nThe swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds , Abby thinks .\nA huge roar .\nThe power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way .\n.\n.\n.\nNobody could have got out of the way .\nNobody .\nThe river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers , then separates them .\nA section of the slide breaks away and keeps going , carrying a number of victims hundreds of metres down the valley .\nDisoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to swim to the surface , this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 metres beneath the concrete-hard snow .\nUp in the trees , Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are dusted by a thick cloud of powder .\nA terrible silence falls over the valley .\nThough their hearts are thumping , they shut down their emotions .\nOn goes the search-and-rescue switch , one they have trained for years to put into practice .\nThey race down to the first group of buried skiers .\nThe only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow .\nThe others , in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley , are buried much deeper .\nAlone at the scene , the husband-and-wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions .\nWho to save first ?\nNot everybody would make it , they reason .\nBut those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival .\nRich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging .\nIt s A. N. .\nHe finds Mr. N s shovel so the group leader can dig himself out , and moves on .\nA. N. has a satellite phone and calls for help .\nBut for the next 45 minutes , except for the victims , Rich and Abby are there by themselves , working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow .\nThe guides transceivers work perfectly , honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons , like shouts from the grave .\nThe couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork .\nOnly dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing .\nClear snow from the victim s face .\nNo CPR before moving on to the next victim .\nThere are too many .\nLet survivors dig themselves out .\nOnce free , the numb and distraught living do their best to help .\nThe victims are scattered beneath the snow .\nRich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible .\nThe first five people they pull out survive .\nThose survivors go on to rescue others .\nEveryone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead .\nThe grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over .\nSeven students make it .\nSeven do not .\nAn hour after the avalanche , seven helicopters , three dogs and more than 30 individuals are on site .\nBy 1 30 p.m. , the final victim has been dug out .\nOne survivor , with a broken ankle , is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital .\nThe remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden s station .\nThe bodies go , too .\nThey are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building .\nChuck Purse , Revelstoke s part-time coroner , is investigating his second seven-death avalanche within two weeks .\nHe examines each body in turn .\nNone show signs of major injury .\nThey were simply swept away and buried , dying from asphyxiation .\nOn Saturday , Feb. 1 , 14 Grade 10 students from Strathcona - Tweedsmuir School south of Calgary , set out on a backcountry ski trip up the Balu Pass in Glacier National Park , B. C. At around 11 45 a.m. , they were caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them .\nHere is the sequence of events on that day .\n1 .\nBefore departing , the leaders checked with the National Park staff for current avalanche conditions .\nThey were advised that the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line and considerable above it .\nStudents were equipped with personal avalanche beacons , probes and shovels .\nAt 8 40 a.m. , students left A. O. Wheeler Hut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Centre , where they conducted at least one test for avalanche risk .\n2 .\n10 15 a.m. Commencement of trip up the Balu Pass trail .\nFollowing standard procedure , the one teacher led and the other adult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers , who were 15 metres from each other .\n3 .\n11 45 a.m. . About halfway up the valley , an avalanche slid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group .\nTwo skiers about 200 metres ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contacted wardens by satellite phone .\n12 30 p.m. Six students were reported alive .\n12 45 p.m. Wardens arrive .\n4 .\n1 30 p.m. All students were accounted for , including the seven who lost their lives .\n1.45 p.m. . One of the students was tobogganed back to the motel with a broken ankle .\nMeanwhile , helicopters joined the rescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot , from where they were transported to a private home in Revelstoke .\nHow the avalanche happened A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain , above the south side of Connaught Creek Valley .\nThis set off a huge second slide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that it rode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward down the valley , burying the group of skiers .\nAnalysis Jan 31-03 Avalanche Bulletin for the NORTH COLUMBIA REGION WEATHER The past week has seen light to moderate snowfall at relatively warm temperatures accompanied by moderate south westerly winds .\nFreezing levels were around 1000 m on Friday and were forecast to lower to valley bottom by the end of the weekend .\nAs the flow turns more north westerly this weekend , weather forecasters predict continuing light to moderate precipitation through Sunday , accompanied by moderate NW winds .\nSNOWPACK Last weekends warm precipitation event produced a substantial crust up to about 2100 m when temperatures dropped .\nWind slabs from 20 to 40 cm thick have formed above this layer from treeline up into the alpine , mostly on North and East aspects .\nSubtle weak layers within this recent storm snow are a concern heading into this weekend , as wind and continuing precipitation will continue to add to the load .\nA series of buried surface hoar weaknesses in the upper two metres will also come under increasing tension as loading increases .\nAVALANCHES Significant avalanche activity earlier in the week has tapered off , although isolated human triggered thin slabs were still being reported on Thursday .\nWith continuing wind and snowfall this weekend , it will still be possible to trigger avalanches in wind loaded areas near treeline and above .\nFORECAST OF AVALANCHE DANGER UP TO MONDAY EVENING FEBRUARY 3 ALPINE - Considerable TREELINE - Considerable BELOW TREELINE Moderate TRAVEL ADVISORY Watch for areas of significant wind loading at all elevations and take note of any signs of instability such as cracking and whumpfing .\nCornices will have weakened with the warm weather .\nIf they fall they can easily trigger avalanches on the slopes below , so keep an eye peeled to slopes above whenever visibility allows .\nUPDATE B. C. Solicitor General Rich Coleman said he s considering emergency funding for an avalanche bulletin to be published every day .\nCurrently , the warning is published three times a week .\nColeman said he may be able to announce funding later this week that would allow the bulletin to be published for the rest of the season .\nThe government had previously cut funding by $ 17,000 for this year .\nBut no matter how much information is available , some people will still decide the risk is worth the back-country experience , Coleman said .\nHe said the government will consider ways of lowering the risk , but no one can ever eliminate it entirely .\nColeman said it would be like closing highways to stop car accidents .\nUPDATE Snow scientist Bruce Jamieson , author of numerous books on avalanches , noted that government funding of avalanche awareness in Canada accounts for only 10 per cent to 12 per cent of the total amount spent .\nThat compares with 50 per cent in the United States and nearly 100 per cent in Europe , he said .\nThe British Columbia government , which withdrew a large chunk of funding last year from a critical avalanche-warning bulletin , is now considering increasing its share of the costs to allow the bulletin to appear every day during high-risk periods .\nUPDATE Sunday , February 09 , 2003 The B. C. government has agreed to pay for more frequent avalanche warning bulletins , after two deadly slides that killed 14 people in eastern B. C. in the past month .\nSolicitor - General Rich Coleman told an open cabinet meeting Friday the province will pay for a series of extraordinary bulletins warning backcountry travellers of elevated avalanche risks .\nIt will raise one more level of awareness , Mr. Coleman said , but added it won t eliminate death .\nThe commitment is less than what the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke , B. C. , had hoped for .\nIt wanted enough money for daily bulletins .\nThe association currently produces three bulletins a week during the winter .\nUnder the new funding arrangement , if something significantly changes between those bulletins -- such as freezing rain , severe temperature variations or increased avalanche activity -- the provincial cash will provide for additional bulletins .\nThe number of special bulletins will be determined by the weather , but a government spokesman estimated there could be six over the remainder of the season , meaning an expenditure of an extra $ 15,000 .\nMr. Coleman said the entire process of issuing a special bulletin will take no more than three or four hours .\nSeven Alberta high school students died in an avalanche on Feb. 1 , while seven adult skiers were killed in a slide on Jan. 20 .\nBoth avalanches occurred near Revelstoke .\nThe B. C. government pulled out of its funding arrangement with the association in 2001 .\nUntil that time the province had covered half the $ 82,000 cost to produce three bulletins a week .\nThe association has been able to continue producing bulletins by raising money in the private sector .\nA seven-day-a-week bulletin in winter would cost $ 250,000 .\nRescue Mode helicopter Injuries fatalities Source Canadian Press , Globe and Mail Contributing Cause s AVALANCHE Top Copyright 2001 - 2002 , The Alpine Club of Canada .\nAll rights reserved .\nAlpine Accidents in Canada\n',115

S. Speed Climbing Championship in 1996 .\nYet among all her achievements , she remains fully grounded , The most important thing for me has not been the end results , the wins , the records .\nI am far more interested in the relationships I have created through climbing , and also the humility with which climbing has helped me approach the world .\nIn 1998 Abby took her skills to the mountains of Pakistan and promptly completed two first ascents in the Nangmah Valley .\nHer ability to set numerous speed-climbing records , on-sight 5.12 , lead grade 6 ice and M8 + mixed routes has proven that she s virtually unstoppable when it comes to climbing .\nPerhaps her background as a dancer and gymnast has helped to fuel her fire , or maybe it s the fact she grew up surfing and swimming in the oceans of Australia .\nIt could be her raw talent and flair for adventure that allows her to continuously add to her talents and her repertoire of successes .\nBut any way you look at it , you ll find Abby sharing her talent and experiences through her Ascending Women clinics and her job as a mountain guide .\nThe North Face - Athletes - Abby Watkins\n',001

the first birthday of a free East Timor .\nA fund raising dinner called The Next Step is to be held in Melbourne on the 2nd of April .\nThe proceeds will go to Timorese beneficiaries .\nFor bookings call 0401 515 144 or email gos@smart.net.au To sponsor Luke and Dan or to assist with Project Ro Halai Taru contact Luke Gosling on 0410 665 268 or email luke_j_gosling@hotmail.com FIRE DEVASTATION TWO MILLION HECTARES BURNT ACROSS THREE STATES The eastern states were devastated over summer with a series of bushfires that started in November and were still burning in some areas as we went to print in late February .\nQuite apart from the tragic loss of life and property that occurred in the towns and cities as the fires raged across three states , the loss and damage to the bush and alpine areas has been enormous .\nThe outdoors community is reeling from the impact on a number of fronts .\nThose who love the bush simply for what it is - a beautiful natural zone that by and large hasn t been changed too much since European settlement - are saddened and are feeling a certain sense of loss with the burning of such huge areas of our peaceful , energy-restoring natural environment .\nThe Mount Hay fire , just one of dozens of the summer fires .\nPhoto Ian Brown The environmental impact has been significant and the extent of the damage is only now being evaluated .\nNick Gellie , a landscape and fire ecologist , says We ve lost a significant amount of biomass .\n.\n.\nre-sprouting will begin 2-3 months after the fires , but what we are afraid we ve lost is old-growth and mature forest , we ve lost things that characterise the snow gum country .\nAnimal losses are sure to be similarly horrifying , although harder to quantify .\nDebbie Andrew , a biologist who studied the impact of the 1994 fires , suggests that while plants and animals around Sydney and the Blue Mountains are in a better position to regenerate and recolonise sites because they are more accustomed to summer fires those in the alpine areas may take up to 100 years to regenerate .\nThe statistics of the summer fires tell a dramatic story In Victoria a stunning 1.3 million hectares was burnt - this is a whopping 17 \% of the state s parks and forests .\nThe 20-year average for Victorian fires to late summer is usually 349 fires that burn 68,200 hectares annually - this year , until mid - February , there had been 717 fires that consumed over a million hectares .\nIn NSW 1.06 million hectares was burnt with over 400,000 hectares burnt in Kosciuszko NP KNP alone .\nThis equals 67 \% of KNP and compares with just 30,000 hectares burnt last year in the park .\nAccess to bush areas has been seriously curtailed for a large proportion of Australian bushwalkers , campers , canyoners and climbers .\nMost of the Victorian high country and KNP , much of the Blue Mountains including Wollemi , Kanangra - Boyd and the central areas and numerous parks and reserves scattered up and down the coast have been off-limits for most of the summer .\nWhole communities , such as the paddlers of northern Victoria , the walkers and canyoners who live in , or visit , the Blue Mountains and mountain bikers around Mount Beauty , have all been left extremely frustrated as fires have kept them out of the bush .\nMost land managers wouldn t put a timeframe on closures but it s safe to say that some burnt areas will be off-limits for many months .\nThe main concern is trees falling on roads or walking tracks , another concern is rehabilitation , said John Ross , a spokesman for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS .\nRoss says that previously threatened and closed areas will be progressively reopened .\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Natural Resources and Energy in Victoria said that no roads or tracks will be closed indefinitely and that road closures are being assessed as the fire situation changes .\nInfrastructure losses within the burnt areas have also been substantial .\nIn one go , this is far and away the worst disaster we ve seen .\nSome people are devastated , to them it s just the same as having their own house burnt down , said Olaf Moon from the Kosciuszko Huts Association when asked about the many huts claimed by the fires .\nTotal hut losses across Namadgi NP , Kosciuszko NP and three Victorian parks currently stand at 27 confirmed burnt , another dozen or so highly likely to be lost and many more of unknown status .\nThe issue of High Country huts has been political in the past , with some land managers showing reluctance to allow rebuilding of destroyed huts , however , this summer saw a good level of co-operation as authorities threw resources at trying to save huts .\nSome inspiring stories came to light , including the NPWS - RFS team who stood with their backs to the walls of Four Mile Hut to save it .\nLiterally , the fire burnt right to the walls .\n.\n.\nthe earth around the huts is completely scorched , said Moon .\nAlina Brown and Lucas Trihey In May this website will host a series of articles concerning the ecological effects of fire , with varied input from ecologists , biologists and others .\nCHECK LIST FOR VISITING FIRE - AFFECTED AREAS - Respect closures in burnt areas .\nThe danger from falling branches and trees is very high after a fire .\nErosion is also a major problem in sensitive areas as they slowly recover from fire damage .\nWandering stock beside roads due to burnt fences is a serious vehicle and animal risk .\n- Stay out of areas close to active fires it sounds obvious but you d be surprised at the actions of some !\n.\n- Maintain a constant vigilance with campfires and stoves .\nEnsure that they are properly extinguished and comply with fire bans again - it sounds obvious , but there have been some scary tales of negligence that have found their way to the Outdoor office !\n- Check the FIRE LINKS page on the Outdoor website Reference pages for up-to-date information on closures , current fires and related topics .\nSTOVE FUEL BOTTLES ON PLANES - NEW RULES The rules on taking camping stove fuel bottles onto planes have been relaxed as long as some simple precautions are taken , including removing all fuel and air-drying the container .\nThe following is an extract from a document titled Significant Changes to the 44th Edition 2003 International Air Transport Association IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations .\nThese changes are claimed to have become effective 1 January 2003 .\nWith operator approval in checked baggage only .\n.\n.\nLiquid-fuelled camping stoves - Provided that steps have been taken to nullify the hazard by draining and air-drying the fuel container , or rinsing the fuel container with cooking oil to raise the flashpoint , then wrapping the fuel container in absorbent material and placed in a polyethylene or equivalent Where the liquid-fuelled camping stove is prepared in this manner it can be classified as non-hazardous .\nThis seems to indicate that the operator still has discretion .\nWhile reports from some travellers indicate that Qantas and Air New Zealand have been permitting fuel bottles as checked baggage it may be worth checking with your airline before you travel .\nThe full IATA document can be viewed at www.cargopak.com\\/news\\/ CANADIAN AVALANCHE KILLS SEVEN Australian mountain guide Abby Watkins witnessed a huge avalanche that buried a large school group near Rogers Pass in British Columbia .\nWatkins and her partner Rich Marshall rushed to the area as soon as the air cleared and saved five of those who were buried .\nTragically , seven others died .\nThe group was made up of 14 students and three adults on a weekend trip .\nFor more details visit www.adventurepro.com.au CALLING ALL FEMALE ADVENTURE RACERS The Creekwalker Team , with members based in Canberra , Adelaide and Sydney , is looking for a female to join their adventure racing team .\nThey ve been placing well in recent races , including some of the Maximum Adventure races and the Polaris , and hope to enter the 2003 Southern Traverse NZ .\nThey are also going to Sabah in Borneo in April this year .\nTo enter some events requires that they are a mixed team - and that means they need a female team member .\nTeam member Andrew Rowe can be contacted on 0411 241 608 .\nSURVIVING EVEREST TO SCREEN 29 APRIL National Geographic Channel will screen a special two-hour film of the National Geographic 50th Anniversary Everest Expedition featuring the sons of some of the original team at 7 30pm on 29 April .\nThe film focuses on the efforts of Jamling Tenzing Norgay , Peter Hillary , and Brent Bishop endash ; the sons of Tenzing Norgay , Sir Edmund Hillary , and Dr Barry Bishop , respectively , as they deal with the challenges thrown up by the mountain and the weather .\nInterviews with the climbing team provide intimate views of the sometimes bittersweet nature of their complex relationships with the legacy of the first ascent in 1953 .\nThe Outdoor website will soon have a series of interviews with the film maker and some of the climbers from this expedition .\nDawa Sherpa , Peter Hillary , Pete Athans and Brent Bishop .\nEPIRB AVAILABILITY A number of organizations are now making it easier for adventurers to obtain an electronic distress beacon EPIRB and PLB for trips .\nA number of Apex clubs around the country offer a free loan service , mostly in coastal areas , but some inland clubs , such as Mansfield in Victoria , are now following the trend .\nSome national park authorities including the visitor centres in Kosciuszko NP also have a cheap hire service $ 10\\/unit\\/trip and a new company called EPIRBhire is offering these devices at commercial rates check www.epirbhire.com.au or call 02 9974 4733 for details .\nSome outdoors retailers also hire units .\nDRAGONSKINS AND HOADLEY HIDE Easter will see two of the biggest events on the scouting calendar with the Dragonskins in NSW and the Hoadley Hide in Victoria .\nBoth events draw scouts from around the country for team events and activities .\nwww.scouts.org.au ADVENTURE EXPO IN SYDNEY 4-6 April will see the Toyota Adventure Expo at Darling Harbour in Sydney , with demonstrations , displays , competitions and interactive features .\nThere will even be an indoor adventure race !\nCall 02 9299 9851 or visit www.adventurexpo.com.au for more information .\nOutdoor is an official Media Partner for the Expo , and we have 25 free passes for our readers .\nThe first 25 people to phone in on Thursday , March 20 no earlier please !\n, with the correct answer to this question will receive one pass In which year was Mt Everest first climbed ?\nEVEREST ANNIVERSARY TREK World Expeditions is putting together a special anniversary trek that culminates with a celebratory banquet , hosted by the Hillary family , below Mt Everest on 29 May 2003 .\nA few places remain , call 1300 720 000 .\nFREE JULBO OUTDOOR GLASSES Outdoor has two pairs of Julbo Outdoor Glasses to give away .\nThese are designed for use in mountaineering , sun , water and snow activities .\nThey offer 100 \% UV protection and feature Alti -

'Climbing Scaling New Heights Climbing can be done on infinite scales ranging in location , terrain , difficulty and accessibility .\nNo matter what the style , it has been defined as gaining elevation through physical work .\nThe sport first emerged in the late 19th century and was first practiced around the great mountain climbing centres in Germany , England , Austria and France .\nTwo styles quickly developed aid climbing , in which equipment was used for upward progress and for safety , and free climbing , where equipment was only for safety .\nFree climbing quickly branched out into various specialities , such as bouldering and indoor climbing .\nTwo types of competitive climbing have emerged classical and speed .\nIn classical competition , the routes are designed to be difficult .\nThe order of start is drawn by lot and climbers have between 30 seconds and a minute to choose a route and only 2 minutes to complete it .\nIn speed competitions , climbers are timed as they climb identical walls at the same time .\nThe one who reaches the top first wins .\nSixteen-year-old Tori Allen from the U. S. is one of the best speed climbers in the world .\nClimbing done vertically is called 5th class climbing .\nThis ranges from the easiest 5.6 to nearly impossible 5.15 .\nBouldering is a fairly new form of freestyle climbing .\nInstead of using a rope and traditional climbing equipment , bouldering climbers attempt short pieces of rock .\nA boulder problem is a particular sequence of moves or particular section of rock that requires climbing techniques and strength to ascend .\nThe tallest boulder problems are 20 to 25 feet .\nBouldering uses the V rating system , which goes from V0 to V14 .\nAnything above V9 is extremely difficult .\nAmerican Lisa Rands is one of the best women in bouldering today .\nBecause bouldering rewards imagination and perseverance ; not only a reliance on pure physical strength , but a challenge of your mental strength , it is making many fans of many women athletes .\nAn ability to stay focused and calm is highly valued in this sport where one wrong move can prove costly .\nWith the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation UIAA governing the sport and an annual World Cup and world championships taking place every year , the sport is now scaling to new heights pun intended .\nUp and coming athletes to pay attention to will be Alex Johnson and Meagan Martin , while Spaniard Josune Bereziartu continues to make her mark on the international climbing scene .\nDid you know ? 34-year-old Abby Watkins , a native Australian , now making her home in British Columbia , has the women s speed record for the Nose of El Cap 16 hrs , 30 min .\nand a medal for speed at the X Games ?\nI m consistently attracted to anything I consider difficult and climbing is hard , she told Mark Cohen , of Gripped Magazine Are you an athlete or association member who can help us add to this section ?\nPlease email us and include SPORTS HELP in your subject line .\nAll rights reserved .\nWomen Warriors 2004 Send this information to a friend Suggest a Sport Related Athletes 2 Related Events in History 13 Related Associations 2\nWomen Warriors - Sports - Climbing\n',085

'abcproject September 19 , 2000 - an adventure in learning - September 11 - 19 Tourist symbolism has not caught on in the far reaches of Western Australia .\nA simple roadsign , the only break in an endless horizon , indicated we had crossed the Tropic of Capricorn for the second time .\nThe coastal region directly below the tropics is unique in that it doesn t experience the dual seasons of the wet and the dry .\nThe climate is close to ideal and the city of Carnarvon makes the most of a year-round growing season with luxuriant plantations that provide all the ingredients for bowls of fruit salad .\nThe wide streets were lined with dazzling displays of poincettas , bougainvilleas and hibiscus and we saw green lawns again thanks to the plentiful supply of water provided by the Gascoyne River .\nWe made the most of the opportunity to sample the fresh fish and prawns that provide another thriving industry to the region .\nCarnarvon Bush Biker Boundary Fence I reached the Overlander Roadhouse hot , tired and dry after 100 km of crosswinds to be met by a sign that warned , Do not ask for water as refusal may offend .\nWe avoided the prospect of being offended by having an ample supply of Carnarvon water and enough time in the day to ride another 35 kms before finding a place to pull off the highway to camp for the night .\nWe had surprise visitors in the morning when two emus walked into camp , at first oblivious to our presence , but then dancing off in their strange swaying , bobbing , wingless gait as they became aware of us .\nIt was a busy morning as their vacated spots were filled by a herd of wild goats .\nWe were to see large numbers of feral goats and sheep in the next few days until reaching the Murchison Boundary fence that stretches for 1700 km across Western Australia providing a barrier to stop them munching on the greening vegetation that met us as we headed south .\nWildflowers are a major reason people travel to Western Australia in the spring .\nThe more we followed the compass south , the more colorful and prolific the roadside displays of wildflowers became .\nThe isolation of Western Australia is a factor in the uniqueness and variety of the species to be found here , numbering up to 12,000 .\nApproaching Kalbarri National Park the road was lined with the silvertipped branches of the smokebush and yellow flowering wattle with clusters of red banksias , grevilleas , kangaroo paws and patches of everlastings in carpets of brilliant pink , yellow and purple .\nIt was a spectacular showcase that slowed our progress as June insisted on identifying each new species she saw .\nAt a roadside reststop I caught up to June who introduced me to a fellow wanderer , Mary Ebbott .\nMary s daughter , Abby Watkins lives in Golden and along with Rick Marshall spends much of her time in the mountains climbing and exploring .\nWe look forward to making a connection with them upon our return .\nKalbarri is one of those jewels on a traveller s roadmap that makes you want to hang around for a while longer .\nSurrounded on one side by heathlands of exquisite wildflowers and on another by the deep red-rock gorges of the Murchison River and yet on another side by an ocean that has carved a jagged coastline of red-banded cliffs , Kalbarri has managed to retain a low profile village atmosphere that provides a sheltered harbor from the storms of the world .\nIt may not have appeared so idyllic for the first settlers in the area .\nBack in 1629 two mutinous crew members from the Dutch East India trading ship , the Batavia were put ashore here , giving them the distinction of being the first European settlers , albeit unwillingly , in this country yet to be discovered by Captain Cook .\nKalbari Cliffs The Batavia shortly thereafter hit a reef and sank as did numerous other early visiting ships to the region .\nThe constant pounding of the Indian Ocean surf has claimed massive chunks of red sandstone and white limestone from the towering cliffs , continuously moulding the landscape into caves , natural bridges and rugged coastal gorges .\nOne of the trips most memorable meals was eaten at Finlay s B.\nB. Q. in Kalbarri , Aussie style , cooked in a tin shed and eaten outside under the stars on a sand floor sitting around a campfire .\nThe pile of seafood and salad was staggering and entertainment was provided by anyone who wanted to get up and play an instrument or sing .\nNeed a napkin ? , grab a toilet roll and drinking water came in wine bottles .\nYou couldn t complain about the service in this restaurant , there wasn t any .\nIf you didn t serve yourself you went without .\nWe thought we had taken a wrong turn out of Kalbarri and had somehow ended up in England .\nThe countryside quite suddenly became rolling green farmland in total contrast to the scenery of the past 3 months .\nNorthampton was a stopover where we visited the local school .\nSet in rolling hills dotted with sheep and smothered in purple wildflowers , it is an agricultural village with a population of 800 and quaint sandstone block buildings .\nTeacher Ann Williams arranged for us to give a presentation to a large group of students ranging in age from grades 1 to 7 .\nThey were a very attentive and well-behaved group of students and it was most rewarding to visit a school that my former students had been emailing from Kimberley .\nFollowing the coast road down to Perth we camped overnight in a shanty town of lobster fisherman shacks .\nLobster fishing is big business which is encouraging the haphazard growth of squatter s shacks along the remote beaches .\nGovernment bulldozers were busy at work on a not-very-popular clean-up campaign .\nNorthampton Norhampton School Pinnacles Desert The southern beaches have the whitest sand we had ever seen , due to a high concentration of lime in the region .\nIt is also one of the richest areas for plant species in the world with the heathlands boasting more than 900 recorded species , more than all the native plants recorded for Great Britain .\nIt is difficult to fathom since the sandy soils are extremely low in nutrients and don t hold moisture well but the plant life has adapted to this adversity and evolved in amazing numbers .\nWe discovered an interesting desert landscape when we visited the Pinnacles Desert near Cervantes .\nHuge limestone pillars rise out of the surrounding desert sands resembling ancient tombstones .\nThe early Dutch explorers seeing them from offshore thought were seeing the remains of an ancient city .\nIt is time for a break and we went in search of a T.

El Capitan Half Dome North American Ice Colorado South America ARGENTINA - PATAGONIA Last season brought a number of new routes and important ascents , completed by parties traveling in a light and fast style .\nUnfortunately , one of the significant factors influencing parties to climb in this style was the season s abysmal weather .\nThroughout October and November the Patagonian climate was as bad or worse than that seen in the past by many of the regular aficionados .\nSome good spells occurred in early December and there were occasional fine days later but by the New Year things had gone dramatically downhill .\nThe snowfall increased to such an extent that the local population were shaking their heads and saying that they had not seen so much snow in the austral summer for more than 15 years .\nNot surprisingly there was noticeable strain amongst climbers based on the Campo de Agostini formally the Campo Bridwell as continuous bad weather led to many unaccomplished dreams .\nSeveral visitors this year have been critical of the growing trend to claim routes which end far from the summit .\nSome of these join other existing routes and others don t even get that far .\nOn the peaks of Patagonia it is generally the last few hundred metres that are unique .\nAs one of the protagonists put it , the hardest metre in Patagonia is the last metre , as you have to get there to climb it .\nThis is particularly true in the normally hostile environment of a region where a few extra hours in the face of an advancing storm can be some of the most terrifying in a climber s career .\nIt may be time once again to look at what constitutes , or not , a first ascent .\nCerro Pollone Italians , Luigi Crippa and Lorenzo Nadali , climbed a new route on the South East Face of this 2,579 m peak northeast of Piergiorgio on the 19th October .\nThis was the first route to be completed in the Chalten region during the 96-97 season .\nTowards the end of 95 Nadali , with Mauro Giriadi and Andrea Sarchi , completed Ensueno on the North West Buttress of Fitzroy to the right of the Supercanaleta and had a clear view of Cerro Pollone opposite .\nIt was at this time that Nadali saw a couloir splitting the triangular lower buttress of the face and resolved to go back and try it .\nCrippa , who is very good on ice numerous hard winter ascents and ice climbs in the Dolomites as well as , incidentally , a number of mixed routes on Ben Nevis , seemed a suitable partner and the pair spent a week waiting for good weather before crossing the Passo Quadrado on the 18th October .\nAfter sleeping for three hours , they continued to the Passo dell Hombre Sentado close to the start of the climb .\nThe ice in the couloir was perfect and the lower four pitches went easily .\nThey then entered a section , hidden from the base of the climb , where the ice runnel narrowed to 50cm and on occasions was no more than 10-15cm wide and sometimes 5cm thick .\nAbove the rock pyramid , at about half-height on the face , the route crossed much easier ground to the west before starting up the left flank of the final ridge .\nThe pitches were thinly iced and one required some aid but conditions were amazingly good , allowing the pair to progress up thin terrain - so thin they felt that were a similar situation to be found in their homeland , it would be impossible for them to make any upward progress .\nThe last pitch was particularly run out and the pair reached the top one report states that the actual summit was not reached in fine weather and light winds .\nDescent was made by rappel five in total following the upper half of the route and then by down-climbing the 50-60 glacier slopes behind the initial rock pyramid to reach their camp on the 20th .\nThe new route , christened Mastica e Sputa Chew and Spit , was 500m long and given an overall alpine grade of ED1 sections of 80-90 see topo .\nA French pair , female climber Laurence Bonoyer and Bruno Sourzac , made the second ascent on the 4th December .\nPiergiorgio In November - December 1995 , Italians Maurizio Giordani and Gian Luca Rampikino Maspes , attempted a new route up the middle of the North West Face .\nGringos Locos has 21 pitches up to 7a and A4 but was terminated well short of the summit see INFOS 164 and 171 and the ropes left in place for a subsequent attempt .\nThat attempt was due to take place last December but when the pair arrived back at the base of the wall , they found their fixed ropes shredded , despite having taken stringent measures to tension them down .\nUnwilling to go through the whole operation again , they turned their attentions to a suitable alternative , the unclimbed North East Ridge which forms the left skyline of the photos published in INFOS 164 and 171 .\nThree difficult pitches led to the col between the Piergiorgio and Cerro Pollone where the pair bivouacked on the night of the 4th December .\nThe following day they moved on to the south flank and climbed 600m of mixed ground rock to 6a and A2 , and ice to WI3\\/70 to reach the huge summit mushroom which is supposedly unclimbable .\nThe route was christened Esperando la Cumbre .\nThe North West Face was the scene of a brief attempt on a new route by the French team of St phane Benoist , St phane Gauard , Pierre Menats and J r me Thini res .\nThese four only managed to climb three pitches and reportedly drilled 40 holes for bat hooks and rivets in only 100m of climbing , before a fall to Gauard , which injured his shoulder and leg , forced the entire team to retreat and concentrate on evacuating the casualty .\nAguja Bifida Two new routes were climbed on this 2,394 m doubled-headed summit which lies on the ridge immediately north of Stanhardt .\nThe strong Italian team of Paolo Cavagnetto , Roberto Giovannetto , Manlio Motto , Gianni Predan and Cesare Ravaschietto arrived in the region during December and hauled gear over the Passo Marconi and on to the Hielo Continental .\nAlthough they had no fixed objective except to climb in the remote wilderness side of the range , they chose the West Face of Bifida , as it still had no lines at that date and other faces in the vicinity looked rather too dangerous .\nThe most well-known member of the team , Manlio Motto , is undoubtedly one of the most prolific Alpine rock-climbers in Italy .\nHe has created over 250 routes , mostly from the ground up and with high standard obligatory moves .\nHe is particularly noted for his wide use of bolts on the virgin compact rock of the Mont Blanc Massif and his numerous new routes throughout this region have been widely reported in these pages .\nThe most compelling line on the Bifida was an obvious diedre which rose to a notch just left of the main or North Summit not reached from any direction until 1989 when an Argentinian \\/ Swiss duo , Bresba and L thi , climbed the North East Face 6a and A1 on mediocre rock .\nUsing fixed ropes on part of the route , the Italians climbed the 16 pitch line to the summit on the 5th-6th and 8th-9th of December .\nThe rock was found to be extremely good and the climbing marvellous .\nApart from the stances , which were fully bolted , one bolt and half a dozen pegs were used , with the main source of protection coming from wires and Camalots up to No. .\n5 .\nThe climbing was mixed free and aid with difficulties up to 6b and A3 Italian and certain other Continental aid grades appear to be different from those widely used in the USA .\nThe rating depends entirely on the difficulty of the moves and not the fall potential .\nThe route was christened Hielo y Fuego , given an overall Alpine grade of ED2 see topo and all members summited .\nAs the weather remained good the team decided to try another line up the pillar leading to the northerly foresummit more or less an independent summit .\nThis they completed from the 10th-12th with a bivouac at the top of the seventh pitch .\nThis 15 pitch route , christened Su Patagunia , was again on superb and very abrasive rock , though the climbing was perhaps not of the same high quality as Hielo y Fuego .\nThe climb finished on the crest of the ridge facing the Quatro Dedos and had maximum difficulties of 6b + one short section of A2 .\nBelays were again equipped and three extra bolts placed for protection .\nOn the 13th the weather turned for the worse and the team evacuated via Piedra del Fraile to Chalten .\nThey note that on this wild side of the range Hielo y Fuego is one of the few routes completed that actually reaches the summit examples of those that don t include Gracias a la Vida on Punta Herron , Cristalli nell Vento on Cerro Torre and Pepe Rayo on Piergiorgio .\nCerro Stanhardt The 1994 Anker \\/ Gerberding line of Tomahawk , a direct start to Exocet up the lower wall of the East Face , received its fourth ascent on the 17th January by the talented Spanish climber , Simon Elias and fellow countryman Josu Merino .\nThe 400m ED2 route was found to give ice climbing up to 95 and rock to 5 and A1 as opposed to the 6a and A2 rating given by the French who made the second and third ascents .\nThe Spaniards had the assistance on the first two pitches of fixed ropes established by another party and climbed the route to within one pitch of the Exocet gully .\nCerro Torre Only one ascent was recorded of this prestigious mountain during the 96-97 season and this proved to be the first complete ascent of the peak since the 1991-92 season .\nSpanish climbers , Simon Elias and Josu Merino reached the top on the 18th February having made the sixth ascent of Casimiro Ferrari s 1974 route on the West Face .\nThe Spaniards spent many hours climbing and digging through the 20m summit mushroom , which turned out to be the most difficult and dangerous pitch of the entire route .\nSeveral years ago , during a filming operation which involved landing a helicopter on the highest point of the Torre , a huge cave was dug in the top of the mushroom to accommodate the film crew and the entrance closed off with a door .\nIt appears that the hole must have caused a significant weakening in the structure and some time later the mushroom keeled over and from all directions presented a formidable challenge .\nIn the last few years parties have avoided climbing this last difficult pitch , considering it either not important or impossible .\nLater in the season veterans , Maurizio Giarolli and Elio Orlando , climbed nine pitches up a new route on the Torre but could not finish it due to the abysmal weather .\nThey left it fixed and plan to return this October .\nNot surprisingly , details of the exact line of the attempt are being withheld .\nAguja Guillaumet The Valtellina based climber , Gian Luca Rampikino Maspes , made a solo ascent of the Argentinian Route with the 1991 variation by Maurizio Giordani who also climbed solo in just five hours on the 8th December .\nThis 600m line on the North West Face has difficulties up to 6a + \\/ 6b and A1 .\nMaspes used a backrope on only one pitch .\nThe Argentinian Route Comesa a \\/ Fonrouge , 1965 5 + and A1 , although the original line to the summit of this 2,579 m rock tower north of Fitzroy , has not become the standard route , that honor now reserved for the 1981 Brenner \\/ Moschini route on the North East Ridge 5 and A1 .\nHowever , last season it appears the original route was repeated on several occasions , as were the French Couloirs on the East Face Coquenoit \\/ Guillot and Amy \\/ Vidailhet climbed in 1968 .\nAguja Mermoz On the 11th December , Giordani teamed up with Aldo Leviti , a highly noted Dolomite climber with many elegant new routes to his credit , to climb a new line on the North West Face to the right of the 1974 Argentinian Route North West Pillar Cuinas \\/ Vieiro 600m 22 pitches 5 + .\nTheir line , which was more or less 700m long , climbed for 16 pitches up the face to join the Argentinian Route on the summit ridge and had difficulties of 6c with a short section of A1 .\nThe summit 2,732 m northeast of Fitzroy was not reached and the climb achieved in a continuous effort of 25 hours from Base Camp to Base Camp .\nLeviti has prefixed a number of his Dolomite test pieces with the name Iper , e.g.\nIperscotoni on the Cima Scotoni and therefore it was no surprise to find this Patagonian route christened Iper Mermoz .\nAguja Poincenot Only one ascent has so far been reported of this 3,003 m summit south of Fitzroy and this was a new route from the American team of Greg Crouch and Jim Donini .\nOn the 3th and 5th December , immediately after their climb on Rafael see below , the pair set off for the North Face , approached as for the Carrington \\/ Rouse Route on the West Face , then continuing for a total of 1,300 m of mixed ground to the base of the wall at the same point as the West North West Pillar first climbed in 1986 at 6a and A2 21 pitches by the Italian team of Bosisio , Panzeri , Della Santa and Vitali .\nThe arrival of a storm caught the Americans halfway up the face on the 5th and although they sat it out for the next two nights , their food ran out and they were forced to retreat to a high camp on the 7th .\nA day later the weather improved and they set off again , spending the night at the top of the fourth pitch and climbing the remaining 13 the following day to the shoulder .\nThe difficulties thus far were rated 5.10 + and A1 and included hard off widths and tight chimneys see topo .\nFrom this point the end of the difficulties , the pair , tired from seven days of continuous action , continued for another three hours of pitching , scrambling and intricate route finding to get to the summit .\nBy sunrise the following morning they were back at their bivouac ledge and after a few hours rest continued down to their camp , having left virtually their entire rack of rappel anchors but well-pleased at having persevered to the true summit .\nThey named the climb The Old Smuggler s Route after the Argentinian whisky that kept them going through the times of bad weather .\nFor Donini 52 this was another superb achievement coming after his new route in Alaska last year with Crouch see INFO 173 20 years after his historic first ascent with Bragg and Wilson of neighbouring Torre Egger .\nFitzroy The first route to be completed during the season on Fitzroy was the Supercanaleta Supercouloir , the 1,700 m gash on the North West Face originally climbed in 1965 during the second ascent of the peak by Argentinians , Comesana and Fonrouge .\nThe French pair Pierre Mahenc and Jean - Philippe Tremblai despatched the route in two days over the 2nd-3rd of December .\nThere were short sections of 90 ice and some rock at 6a .\nThe first ascent of the couloir was an impressive achievement for the era by climbers who were completely unknown outside of their own country .\nThe route resisted a second ascent until 1977 .\nThe standard route up the South East Pillar Franco - Argentinian 14 pitches normally climbed at 6b and A1 , followed by mixed climbing up the summit ridge was climbed by a six man Russian team which spent 12 days on the route , summiting on the 1st February .\nIn January 1986 an Italian team from Trieste Carlo Bormolini , Massimo Boni , Mauro Petronio , Angelo Pozzi , Mauro Rontini and Marco Sterni , climbed the huge North Diedre to give Tehuelche .\nThis 1,200 m and 46 pitch route was climbed in a final push of seven days .\nIt was mostly free up to 6a but with a short section of 6b and some A1 and A2 .\nThe team reported joining the 1979 French Route on the North Face less than 50m from the summit , at which point they terminated their ascent in high winds and rappelled the route .\nThe Argentinian climber , Rolando Garibotti , now resident in Colorado , had dreamed of making an Alpine style ascent of this route ever since copying the original topo at the park headquarters when a teenager of 15 .\nLast December he teamed up with American , Doug Byerly , to do just that .\nThe pair completed the climb in a 34 hours push over the 8th-9th but found that the point where the Italians had stopped was some 120m from the summit , the first three pitches of which still involved tricky mixed ground .\nByerly and Garibotti s first integral ascent of the route used no fixed ropes , though the pair were dismayed to find the line completely littered with gear from the first ascensionists .\nThe Italians had apparently fixed the entire route and left 1,200 m of rope in place .\nByerly and Garibotti cut away nearly 90 \% of the 10 years old decaying material and threw it down to the glacier , together with a sack full of rotting clothing left on a stance .\nThey started out from a high camp at 5am on the 8th in perfect weather but first had to ascend the Sitting Man Ridge , a climb in itself with around 1,000 m of moderate ice and sections of mixed terrain .\nClimbing unroped they reached the top of this ridge in three hours and started up Tehuelche at 11am , finding extremely enjoyable climbing and some of the best granite that either had ever touched .\nOn the first day they climbed with quite heavy packs containing bivouac gear and food for three days .\nAfter 20 pitches , some of which were wet or icy , they reached a big ledge called the Grand Hotel and stopped for the night .\nAlthough it clouded over that evening , the next day dawned fine and the pair continued up the Diedre de Marco , named after Marco Sterni , the star Italian rock-climber who led the entire feature .\nThis gave the hardest climbing on the route and was often difficult to protect due to the off width nature of the cracks .\nAs the day continued warm , the upper pitches became increasingly wet and the finish involved an A1 section up a now gushing waterfall .\nSeveral pitches of climbing , still in rock boots , above the point where the Italians turned back led to easier mixed ground and eventually the true summit , a thin blade of granite .\nThe weather remained stable and the pair made it back to the Grand Hotel that night for a few hours sleep before continuing down to the foot of the wall just 48 hours after starting out .\nThe line , which they comment involves some great free climbing , was completed at 6b + and A2 see topo .\nAguja Rafael Inominata Doug Byerly and Rolando Garibotti made the fourth ascent of the original Anglo - American Route via the West Face and South Ridge Boysen \\/ Braithwaite \\/ Dickenson \\/ Reid USA \\/ Sylvester USA , 1974 5 + \\/ 6a on the 2nd December .\nThis gives 450m of splendid and sustained climbing and was the second time Garibotti had climbed the route he made the third ascent in 1995 with American , Charlie Fowler .\nThis time the pair climbed a new four pitch variation to give the route an overall technical grade of 6b and A0 .\nOn the same day , Americans Greg Crouch and Jim Donini , attempted the first ascent of the West Ridge , hoping the route would go easily in the day as a warm up for the season ; it didn t. After 24 pitches of difficult mixed climbing and rather convoluted route finding , plus a bitterly cold open bivouac , they joined the Anglo - American route at the notch some six pitches short of the summit .\nUnable to continue above this point due to sheer exhaustion and dehydration the pair retreated .\nThe line had difficulties of 5.10 and A1 plus ice\\/mixed to 80 but because of their commendably high ethical standards , where any Alpine route is not completed unless the summit is reached , the pair do not consider this a new route though many current Patagonian activists might and have declined to name it .\nRather it simply felt like we had gotten our butts kicked by one of the smallest peaks in the range .\nAguja St Exup ry South of Rafael , this 2,558 m rock tower received at least three ascents last season , two from Garibotti .\nThe day after their ascent of Rafael , Byerly and Garibotti headed back up for an attempt on the 1988 Giordani \\/ Valentini line Chiaro di Luna on the 800m high West Face .\nHowever , due to very cold conditions the pair could not start the climb until midday and then were forced to use aid on the initial cracks which were very iced .\nOnce they moved on to better rock conditions they speeded up and managed to reach the summit in 10 hours , just before dark , after a total of 28 pitches up to 6c .\nRappelling through the dark the rope jammed at around 2am and the pair sat out a very cold night before easily freeing the offending rope in the daylight and continuing safely down to their camp the following morning .\nAround on the East Face two members of a Russian team climbed the superb 800m East Pillar used to make the first ascent of the tower in 1968 by the Italian team of Buscaini , Condot , Metzeltin , Romano and Sinigoi 800m 5 + and A2 climbed all free at 6c except for one short aid section by Schwitter and Ishibe in 1993 .\nThe pair reached the summit on the 27th December .\nOne day later , during a 24 hours period of good weather after a long spell of bad , Garibotti , moving light and fast , managed to solo the 1988 Harrington \\/ Kearney Route 550m 6a + on the North West Face .\nDue to the previous poor weather the conditions were icy which made the climbing slow as each hold had to be checked for verglas .\nEven so , Garibotti climbed mostly unroped , self-belaying only a few sections and reached the top in fours hours .\nHe was back at camp for afternoon tea .\nAguja de la S In addition to the climbs reported in INFO 164 Pablo Besser and the Argentinian , Gadi Slomka , repeated the Austrian Route B rnthaler \\/ Lidi , 1987 on the East Face of the Aguja de la S 2,350 m , one of the smallest granite peaks on the main ridge several kilometres south of Fitzroy .\nFrom a bivouac at the edge of the glacier above the Rio Blanco Base Camp the pair made their ascent on the 6th February 1996 in excellent weather , climbing first three snow pitches at c60 and then the 10 rock pitches above at 5.10 b and A0 .\nThe rock section follows a prominent diedre offering predominantly wide cracks in excellent granite .\nThe climbers replaced all the rappel anchors on their descent .\nIt is perhaps interesting to note that Hans B rnthaler , who made the first ascent of this route and was active in both Patagonia and the Himalaya in the late 1980s routes include a first ascent on Aguja St Exup ry plus the Voie Normales on Cho Oyu and Xixabangma Main Summit , was tragically killed in 1989 on the Austrian K2 East Face expedition .\nBad weather prevented the team from making much progress and while B rnthaler was climbing a small peak on the opposite side of the glacier in order to take photographs of the face , he was swept away by a windslab avalanche .\nEl Mocho The squat rock tower at the foot of the South East Ridge of Cerro Torre received at least four ascents during the season .\nThe French duo , Bonoyer and Sourzac , with fellow countrymen Pierre Mahenc and Jean - Philippe Tremblai , made an ascent of the Central Ice Gully , climbed in 1987 by Grassi , Pe and Rossi and christened All or Nothing but often referred to as the Grassi Goulotte .\nThe two French pairs climbed the 400m TD + 80 route up the East Face on the 26th November .\nLater , on the 6th December , Byerly and Garibotti attempted this line but found it too dangerous as a result of the recent warm weather .\nOn the 12th December , the Swiss pair Denis Burdet and Jean Zweiacker , made a relatively early repeat of the 1989 Anker \\/ Piola route Voie des B nitiers on the South Pillar this route had its second ascent on the 31st December 1993 .\nThis 500m route 14 pitches on the pillar followed by the summit ridge was originally graded F6c and A2 6b obl , though is now considered 6c and A1 .\nThe route was climbed again on the 18th January 97 by Rolando Garibotti and Gian Luca Maspes .\nCerro Marconi Norte Maurizio Giordani climbed a new route , solo , on the north flank of this peak above the Passo Marconi on the 9th December .\nThe 500m line had maximum difficulties of 4 .\nPUNA DE ATACAMA The highest peaks in Chile and also those in Argentina apart from Aconcagua , lie near the southern limits of the Atacama Desert and are rarely visited due to the extreme isolation and lack of water .\nThe Atacama is commonly considered the world s driest desert area .\nThere has been a long debate as to whether Pissis or Ojos del Salado , the latter often referred to as the highest active volcano in the world , is the second highest summit in the Americas after Aconcagua .\nRecent accurate Argentinian surveys give the benefit of the doubt to Pissis and the Argentine IGM sheet 2769 - III at 1 250,000 , the only accurate topographical map in existence to feature both summits , now marks Ojos as 6,864 m and Pissis at 6,882 m.\nThere may of course be a little political skulduggery there as Ojos lies on the border with Chile whereas Pissis is entirely within Argentina .\nAny controversy may well be eliminated after August 97 , when Mike Jenkins takes his team of British Military Surveyors from the Royal Engineers to climb Ojos together with a group of like-minded Chilean surveyors .\nIn 1993 Jenkins and his team climbed Chimborazo and made a complex differential GPS survey of the mountain , arriving at an altitude of 6,267 m , some 40m or so lower than the long accepted height .\nThe Ecuadorians were so impressed with this technique that they now use the new height on all their official maps see INFO 136 .\nThe Argentinians used identical techniques to come up with the height of 6,882 m for Pissis in 1995 see INFO 150 but Ojos has yet to have any such treatment and may yet prove the higher mountain .\nJenkins compares today s military surveyors to the old Survey of India team who first explored many of Asia s high peaks in the last century .\nNames such as George Everest , Colonel Montgomerie and Kenneth Mason ensure a proud tradition of military surveyors and one which still compels the modern day descendants to travel to unknown lands .\nIn October \\/ November 1996 three British mountaineers , Gordon and John Biggar plus Richard Wilkins , made some interesting first British ascents in the region including Pissis .\nThe team approached the largely snowless mountains from the village of Fiambala in Northern Argentina and first made an ascent of the very rarely climbed Cazadero 6,658 m , which lies to the southwest of Ojos and is also known as Walther Penck .\nThe volcano was originally climbed by Japanese in 1970 and only appears to have received one ascent since , by a group from Chile in 1991 .\nThe British team climbed the easy northern slopes .\nAll three then made an ascent of the Argentinian side of Ojos del Salado , reaching the summit on a cold and windy 31st October .\nThe group then transferred the 75km south to Pissis and made the ascent on the 10th November via the North Glacier from a high camp at 5,900 m.\nThose final c1 ,000 m took only six hours in near perfect weather , a particularly notable achievement for Gordon Biggar and Wilkins , aged 59 and 60 respectively .\nPissis was first climbed by the Poles in 1937 with a second ascent not recorded until 1985 .\nTwo Americans , Kent Pierce and Stuart Richie who reached the top on the 27th February this year at the end of a 17 days stint , in which they climbed all three highest summits in South America Pissis reached by a remote cross country drive involving an unauthorized border crossing in to Argentina , found the summit register to contain entries for less than 10 ascents since 85 .\nThis lack of attention may soon change if the label second highest peak in the Americas is widely accepted .\nMost ascents appear to have been made either by very small parties or solo .\nJohn Biggar , who has made ascents of over 20 of the 50 highest peaks in the Andes and is the author of the recent publication The High Andes - A Guide for Climbers , went on to solo three more of the volcanoes Olivares 6,216 m , Majadita 6,266 m much further south of Pissis and Nacimiento del Jague 5,829 m .\nThe latter is a subsidiary summit of Nacimiento 6,493 m immediately south of Cazadero and was possibly unclimbed before this ascent .\nCHILE 1995-96 Hielo Patagonico Sur Following our brief report in INFO 164 on the Arved Fuchs Expedition to cross the Hielo Patagonico Sur the Southern Patagonian Ice Cap and explore the Falla de Reichert , we can now give more details on the climbing that took place on the Ice Cap to the east of the Fiordo Peel .\nFuchs , perhaps best known for his Trans - Antarctic crossing with Messner in 1989 and his claim to be the first man to walk to both North and South Poles within 12 months , had sailed from Canada in his yacht , Dagmar Aaen , with a crew of Germans , one Alaskan and one Icelandic girl .\nThey were joined in Valparaiso by Chilean mountaineer , Pablo Besser , on the 1st October 1995 .\nAfter considerable bureaucratic problems with the Chilean government , they all set sail for Canal Baker and the Jorge Montt Glacier at the northern end of the ice cap .\nWhile Fuchs and team began their journey south , the boat sailed to the Peel Fjord and Besser , with the Icelandic girl Sigga Ragna Sverrisdotir , an excellent ice climber , traveled over 55km in an inflatable dingy to the head of the Peel .\nThere they climbed up a steep and previously unexplored glacier , christened Margarita Glacier , on to the ice cap .\nPulling 30 days food and equipment on pulks , they finally reached the Japan Plateau and headed east for two days to make their first Base Camp near to the Malaspina Mountains .\nFrom there they climbed Cerro Centinel 2,393 m in poor conditions and Cerro Dagmar Aaen 2,050 m , the latter in soft snow ending with a 50m ice pitch and a classic Patagonian mushroom .\nAfter a spell of bad weather they moved camp to the base of Cerro Immaculado 2,374 m where they made the first ascents of Immaculado , Mirador del Hielo 2,078 m , Punta Ilusion 2,533 m and Punta Aparicion 2,100 m .\nThese have now been adopted as official names and heights on 1996 versions of maps to the area .\nBesser and Sverrisdotir were also the first to cross the Garcia Glacier and Col 1,300 m or Corredor Chileno .\nFuchs , with team members Till Gottbrath and Roger Schmitt , met up with the pair on the 20th November but a 10 day storm , which destroyed one of the tents , put paid to the journey further south and the entire team traversed the Falle de Reichert Mayo Fall , a c1 ,000 m chasm of seracs cutting the ice cap never before crossed except by helicopter , and reached the Peel Fjord on the 3rd December .\nWhile completing this route , Besser , Gottbrath , Schmitt and Sverrisdotir made the first ascent of Cerro Cuatro Vientos .\nThe significance of the Arved Cross is that it was the longest north-south traverse of the ice cap yet made without helicopter support or mid journey stop for a rest and re-stock .\nBesser hoped to return with three friends and make the first complete traverse of all 500km of the Hielo Sur during the 1996-97 season but the outcome of this proposed expedition is still unknown .\nAn interesting west to east traverse of the ice cap took place in March 96 when Germans , Carsten Birckhahn , Merten Puschmann and Tilman Steinhardt , took just over four weeks to travel from Peel Fjord to the Lago Argentina .\nThey first reached the fjord with plastic kayaks and then , using them as pulks , dragged their equipment 1,000 m up on to the ice cap and continued east .\nTheir original project was to carry on down via the Santa Cruz river all the way to the Atlantic coast but it is thought that this part of their novel journey may well have been aborted .\nPaine Due to the counter-productive act by CONAF , still in operation during the 1995-96 season , of charging a high fee for climbing in the National Park , only 10 teams registered to climb during the entire six months of the austral summer .\nPerhaps as a consequence of this and due also to continued foreign pressure , the authorities reduced the fee previously $ 850 per climbing team to $ 100 per person for the 1996-97 season .\nAlthough far from a perfect solution to the problem , the new fee does encourage small teams in the area , though the authorities still make no attempt to provide a service for the royalty .\nNews from the past season is still scanty , though there has been a new route but not to the summit on The Shield , a hard big wall route on the East Face of Cerro Cota 2000 in the Frances Valley and a second ascent of the Thomas \\/ Turner line Caveman on Cuerno Norte in the same valley .\nFor the moment we take the opportunity to catch up on previously unreported ascents from early 1996 .\nThe Towers After completing the Arved Cross Expedition described above , Pablo Besser arrived at Paine in January .\nBesser epitomized most Chilean nationals at the time in that he was furious at suddenly having to pay $ 300 in order to climb in his own country .\nHe made two attempts on the South Tower by the North Ridge the original 1963 Aste Route c900m F5\\/5 + and A1 but was defeated by the weather .\nHowever , as a consolation he managed to climb the ever popular Monzino Route , which forms the original and classic route of ascent on the South Ridge of the North Tower , with Englishman , Martin Chester , on the 12th .\nThe two climbed the 400m route above Col Bich in a fast three and a half hours at VI and A0 .\nAlso in the Paine during January and February was the American team of Scott Lazar , Michael Pennings and Cameron Tague .\nThese three first made the second ascent of the 1992 Piola \\/ Sprungli route , Ultima Esperanza 500m ; 6b and A2 on the West Pillar of the North Tower s South Summit .\nThey climbed the route in a day , with a three pitch variation , at a grade of 6c and A2 .\nLater , after three days of preparation , the same three climbed the West Face of the Central Tower by the 1993 Italian route , Via de las Mamas Barbolini\\/de Dona \\/ Pozzi \\/ Rampini \\/ Veghetti 750m 6b and A2\\/3 .\nThis was the second ascent .\nFinally , they completed the trilogy by reaching the summit of the South Tower via the original but still infrequently ascended 1963 Aste Route .\nEarlier , the little repeated 1963 British Route on the Central Tower Bonington \\/ Whillans 700m best free attempt now 6b with some aid but thought to be possible at 7a\\/b received an ascent in Alpine style by the strong German - Australian team of Carsten Birckhahn and Andrew Mc Auley .\nThey climbed the route in December 95 and are thought to be only the third party to have summited the Central Tower without a bivouac .\nAfterwards the same pair were reported to have climbed the North Tower twice ; first by the Monzino Route and then by making the second ascent of The Corn Wall - the South West Rib climbed in 1993 by Celia Bull , Leigh Mc Ginley and Paul Pritchard at 6b 10 pitches to the junction with the Monzino Route .\nThe Pingo Valley In the Pingo Valley , which runs north from Lago Nordenskjold to the South Tower and gives access to the East Faces of the Cuernos , the Chilean pair of Sven Bruchfeld and Christian Oberli made the first ascent of the East Face of Hoja in January .\nThis 14 pitch , c400m route was climbed in classic style using fixed ropes at a reported grade of 5.10 a and A1 .\nIn February , the Americans , Pennings and Tague , also turned their attention to the valley , first climbing the 450m high East Face of Cuerno Este via a line graded 5.11 and A1 and then a route on the East Face of Hoja , which they christened Anduril the relation between this and the Chilean Route a month previously is unknown .\nThis last climb was completed in a round trip of 15 hours from the valley and was almost entirely free .\nThe first climb ever to be achieved from the Pingo Valley only took place in 1995 the East Face of Cuerno Norte .\nLast year three parties succeeded on four routes .\nApart from those just described , a team of young Germans were successful in completing the first ascent of Cuerno Principle s East Face see INFO 164 Note Last minute correspondence following interviews with several Italian climbers involved in some of the routes mentioned in this report suggests that comments regarding whether or not summits were reached or routes completed may have arisen from misinformation .\nDetails and\\/or corrections will appear in the next issue . .

Negruni region in February 1997 .\nThis is the austral summer , the rainy season and a time in which few ever visit the mountains .\nHowever , the German pair were aware that in recent years glacial recession had been significant and steep faces melted quickly with the arrival of the customary fine weather in late May - June , leaving vast areas of bare rotten rock although not all the granite in this region is poor .\nCertainly by mid - June many of the couloirs used by parties that made the first ascents of these fine peaks in the early 1970s , are now snow-free , stone-swept chutes .\nWhile the Germans found large quantities of snow on the mountains and acceptable conditions for mixed climbing , they unfortunately coincided with the worst wet season for 30 years and experienced copious amounts of bad weather .\nOn the 10th February they climbed a new route , Pan Duro , on the right side of the South West Face of Cerro Culin Thojo South 5,350 m .\nThis 450m high mixed climb had rock difficulties of IV and snow\\/ice to 65\\/70 .\nThree pegs were left in the rotten rock .\nTwo days later they climbed Andal , a 380m mixed route up the North Couloir of Pt 5,350 m to the west of Cerro Ventanani .\nAgain the rock was poor IV - maximum and the snow\\/ice climbing between 55-65 with one section of 70 .\nFinally , on the 14th , the pair climbed the East Face of Pt 5,400 m , the location of which is unclear though it is described as a subsidiary peak of Wila Lloje .\nThe 350m climb , christened Caramba , which involved rock to IV + and snow\\/ice to 65-70 , was again primarily composed of loose blocks and the ubiquitous rotten rock .\nTwo pegs and a sling were abandoned on the climb .\nAll these peaks or sub peaks lie close to the valley and most probably received their first ascents during 1971-73 when two large German expeditions explored the region .\nHowever , it is quite possible that the recent exploration by the two Germans produced the first new routes ever climbed in the Cordillera during the summer .\nOn the 16th a big landslide destroyed the 4 WD access road , which now continues over the Paso Mullu and down to the jungle villages .\nBirnbacher and Wiebel had no option but to walk out to the main highway , a distance of 30km .\nDespite this , they report removing all rubbish from their Laguna Janko Kkota Base Camp , returning it too La Paz for recycling .\nUnfortunately , rubbish disposal in La Paz usually takes the form of moving it from the richer to the poorer areas i.e.\nEl Alto .\nIllampu On the 800m + mixed West Face of this magnificent 6,368 m summit at the northern tip of the Real , already crossed by routes from Gabarrou , Villarroel and three hard mixed lines by Slovenian climbers , it is reported that a French pair have added another new route in September 96 .\nEntourloupe gave sustained mixed\\/ice climbing with an overall Alpine grade of TD .\nIllampu was first climbed on the 7th June 1928 via the South West Ridge by the German , Erwin Hein and Austrians , Alfred Horeschowski , Hugo Hoertnagel and Hans Pfann .\nOzono Information and logistical support for expeditions to Bolivia s Cordilleras is now available through Ozono , a new British -

like granite peak and the four climbed the obvious pillar and corner system on the left side of the face in 20 sustained pitches of mixed free and aid climbing up to new wave A3 + and VI + see topo .\nExtremely strong winds combined with cold stable weather caused many problems , especially on the lower half of the route .\nOn Ulvetenna in 1994 Caspersen and team had found the granite often loose and friable due , no doubt , to the harsh and variable climatic environment .\nThis time the four Norwegians , again climbing in capsule style , found mostly good steep granite with a few notable and serious exceptions and completed the route from the 23rd December - 8th January .\nINFO Aslak Aastorp North America ALASKA Kichatna Spires As reported in INFO 173 two new routes were completed in the Alaskan Cathedral Range , more popularly known as the Kichatna Spires , during June 1996 by 19 years old American , Calder Stratford , and British climber Kevin Thaw .\nThaw , who took up partial residence in the USA in the late 80s and is now more or less resident there , was the first British climber to lead consensus A5 with his ascent of Sea of Dreams on Yosemite s El Capitan in 1994 .\nThe pair were flown into the unfrequented region south of the Mc Kinley group on the 29th May and deposited on the Tatina Glacier .\nHeeding the advice that when the unpredictable weather sets fair in this region , climbers should not waste any time there are no real hours of darkness at this latitude until August , the pair set out for a fine granite wall on an unnamed 2,560 m peak immediately west of Tatina Spire .\nThe south buttress of what they later dubbed Punter s Peak , gave seven 60m pitches to the interminable summit ridge .\nThis in turn offered easy Fifth Class climbing with the occasional boulder problem .\nTwo days were spent on the buttress and ropes were fixed single bolt belays on to the headwall where flaring cracks and loose exfoliating flakes gave more free climbing .\nThree of the pitches , crossing a series of roofs , were entirely on aid modern A3 with much use of copperheads and skyhooks .\nThe free climbing standard on the rest reached a maximum of 5.10 .\nThe route was christened Dreams of Sea and given an overall V rating .\nThe weather turned bad for the next 10 days or so , then miraculously cleared three days before the pre-arranged flight out .\nStratford and Thaw quickly assembled gear for an attempt on a southern satellite of Tatina Spire and starting just right of the lowest point of the south buttress , free climbed the often lichenous wall , which prompted the route name Alaskan Rose , to the golden headwall .\nThis formed the crux and had some run out climbing with a steep crack\\/trough at 5.11 c.\nMore lichen forced them out left into a corner system near the top .\nThey reached the summit after a total of nine long pitches , placing single bolt belays backed up with rivets .\nAlaskan Rose was also rated V. Though these two routes were fairly short , they were probably the steepest that the valley had to offer .\nCathedral Mountains Not to be confused with the group of spires above , this small isolated range of peaks , which appear to offer fine granite walls up to 300m high , lie west of Mt Foraker and until last year had not previously been visited by any climber .\nIt was therefore perhaps rather apt that the first party into the region should have as one of its members the greatest of all American pioneers , the indefatigable Fred Beckey .\nTogether with Calvin Herbert and the well-known big wall guru , John Middendorf , Beckey , who has now climbed over 1,000 new routes in North America , attempted the unnamed highest summit in the group .\nThe only real technical piece of climbing involved a 5.5 loose rock wall to gain the fine summit snow ridge .\nBeckey led this pitch and , in deference to the 73 years old living legend , the other two climbers propose the name Mount Beckey for the 2,590 m summit .\nMount Foraker Jeff Benowitz soloed a new route on a spur that lies between Mt Crosson and the Japanese Route through the North East Icefall .\nBenowitz reached the crest via a 450m couloir on the north flank in order to bypass the loose rock buttress that terminates the spur .\nHe then continued for 20 pitches , all of which he backroped , up the narrow corniced crest to an easing in difficulty .\nContinuing unroped , Benowitz reached the crest of the Sultana Ridge at c3 ,475 m.\nDue to poor weather throughout his time on the mountain , the 16 hours of climbing that Benowitz spent in completing the route , now christened The Way , was in fact spread over six days .\nThe 1966 Japanese Route , climbed during the third ascent of the mountain , reaches the crest of the Sultana higher up .\nWhile it is technically straightforward and has been repeated on several occasions , it is very prone to snow and ice avalanches .\nMc Kinley Apart from Steve House s ascent of the Washburn Wall , reported in INFO 167 , another new route was climbed on the Great One during 1996 .\nSlovakians Juraj Hreus and Jan Surcek started climbing parallel to the Messner Couloir , then traversed up and left past Bugs Mc Keith s 1976 solo climb , Mc Clod s Rib and Scott Johnston s 1978 Hourglass Couloir to reach the series of rocky ribs on the North West Face , lying above the traverse out to Denali Pass on the Standard Route .\nTwenty five pitches of mixed ground from 45-75 up these ribs led to the summit ridge .\nWrangell Mountains Paul Barry , David Hart , Harry Hunt and David Lacey climbed a new route on the 4,095 m Mt Natazhat .\nThe four climbers followed the c8km crest of the North East Ridge from a starting height of 2,315 m.\nA narrow corniced ridge led over Pt 2,789 m and Pt 2,915 m before reaching the final 1,200 m summit ridge which proved to be the crux of the climb .\nTheir ascent also proved to be only the second of this mountain .\nSt Elias Range Mount Miller Carlos Buhler , Paul Claus , Ruedi Homberger , Reto Ruesh and Charlie Sassara made the first ascent of the highest remaining unclimbed peak in the St Elias Range .\nFrom an airdrop at only 1,280 m on the Bagley Icefield the five climbers tackled a broad south-facing spur leading up on to the crest of the West Ridge of Miller at c2 ,450 m.\nThey then followed the increasingly difficult crest for five and a half kilometres to the 3,400 m summit , successfully negotiating the crux section over a steep icy dome .\nThe route , which had a vertical interval of over 2,000 m , was climbed in a continuous 32 hours .\nCoastal Range Devil s Thumb Spanish climber , Sim n Elias and American , Chad Mc Mullen , climbed a new route on the North West Face of the Cat s Ear Spire , the neighbouring rock tower to the Devil s Thumb close to the border between Southern Alaska and British Columbia .\nAfter an initial ice couloir 60 with a step of 90 over a rimaye leading up to the notch below the North West Pillar , where they made a first bivouac , the pair climbed on the right flank of the ridge with a second bivouac to the summit .\nThe initial section was 6a and A1 then the route continued free with passages of 5 + .\nThe total length of the climb was 600m .\nThe pair were then joined by Jeff Selvig for an unsuccessful attempt on the South West Diedre of the Thumb .\nThe route started with 200m of vertical rock 6a just left of the crest of the South Pillar , then worked up left to reach the huge diedre in the middle of the face 6a and A2 maximum .\nAfter 800m of climbing and one bivouac the trio were less than 100m from the summit when it appears that a rockfall hit the ledge where they had left their bivouac gear and carried away sleeping bags .\nNot wanting to risk a night out unequipped in the prevailing low temperatures the team decided to retreat .\nThis spectacular granite monolith was first climbed in 1946 by Beckey , Craig and Schmidtke .\nINFO Kevin Thaw YOSEMITE The Valley experienced a ravaging wet year in 1996 .\nThe season had barely started when a huge storm hit the area .\nSeveral feet of snow then began to melt quickly in the warmth of May and the resulting run off caused the rivers to flood .\nThe Merced burst its banks causing havoc in the campgrounds and washing away both possessions and aspirations of visiting climbers .\nPerhaps not entirely unrelated to this deluge was the huge rockfall on the 10th July from close to the rim above Glacier Point Apron .\nThis event , which has already been well-reported in a previous High , flattened one and a half metre diameter trees nearly one kilometre away and killed one person .\nThe fall left everything covered with large quantities of dust and a huge area of scarred earth with unstable boulders perched high above the Apron .\nThe Park Authorities closed the area from Goodrich Pinnacle east , which includes routes on the Mouth and the Cow and also the line of Galactic Hitchhiker , perhaps the longest free rock climb in the USA , completed in the autumn of 1995 by Matt Brooks and Lou Renner at VI , 5.11 a\\/b .\nThis route , described in High 173 , has 41 pitches to the rim , out of which 31 are new .\nIt remains to be seen whether routes such as these are still entirely intact .\nTo add insult to injury the season ended with the usual , if somewhat premature , snowfall .\nHowever , this was later followed by a warm wet storm .\nFor the second time in a year the Merced broke its banks and welled up over the valley floor , this time creating the biggest flood in history with considerably more devastation than its spring counterpart .\nSeveral campgrounds were totally washed away , as was a sewerage line , and many large boulders were deposited on various roads around the park .\nThe Cookie cliff suffered considerable fresh rockfall , as did many of the other crags which line Highway 140 between El Portal and the Valley .\nThe worse flooding appears to have been caused by debris clogging up the watercourse at Pohono Bridge near to Bridalveil Falls .\nThe resulting dam forced water back in to the Valley and briefly closed all the Park exits .\nAt one stage Yosemite Lodge , Yosemite Village and Curry Village were all isolated from one another by flood water .\nA large boulder destroyed the dining room of the Parkline Restaurant at El Portal and the rest of the building was burned in order to prevent debris from creating another blockage .\nBoth Pines campgrounds , the River campgrounds and the Housekeeping area suffered major damage and some of these may never re-open .\nHowever , Sunnyside , the traditional climbers camp , is some distance above the river and appears to have survived relatively unscathed .\nThe Park remained closed from January - March 97 and although at the time of writing details of the current situation are unknown , the repair cost has been estimated at around $ 180,000,000 .\nThere is a rumor that the Park Service may try to introduce a system of one day permits for visitors , though whether this would effect climbers attempting multi-day routes is unsure .\nThe Big Walls El Capitan Our report in INFO 163 concerning the second and third ascent of Dante s Inferno contained several minor errors .\nThe second ascent was made by two Americans and not Scandinavians as stated and took five not four days .\nThe third ascent by the Danish climber , Ravn Hamberg , and the Swiss , Aischan Rupp , which resulted in the first one day ascent , began at 5am with the pair carrying one small rucksack between them .\nAlso omitted from the report on the previous autumn s activities was probably the first single push ascent of El Capitan s Aquarian Wall in 30 hours during October by Rupp and the Argentinian climber Rolando Garibotti .\nRupp was back in the Valley again in early summer 1996 and teamed up with the Norwegian Lofoten Islands expert , Odd - Roar Wiik , to make the fifth ascent of the hard test piece , Jolly Roger .\nThis route was first climbed in 1979 by Charles Cole and Steve Grossmann but has seen few subsequent attempts , let alone repeats second ascent in 10 days by the late Xaver Bongard from Switzerland climbing solo ; third by the well-known American Brad Jarret also climbing solo ; fourth in 1993 by the Slovenians , Janez Jeglic and Miha Prapotnik .\nThe Swiss - Norwegian pair climbed the 23 pitch route VI , 5.10 , A5 , which begins above the Mammoth Ledges on the South West Face between The Shield and Son of Heart , in seven days from the 4th to the 10th June .\nTheir ascent was made in Alpine style without fixing ropes .\nThe pair used epoxy putty to reinstate much of the original hard climbing by filling up many of the drilled holes added after the Cole \\/ Grossman ascent .\nAs one activist said there have been a mistaken few in the past who have sought out glory on the big walls and reduced the commitment by drilling for security .\nSadly , Rupp was killed earlier this year in a rappel accident while descending the Hornli Ridge on the Matterhorn having just completed a very fast winter ascent of the North Face .\nBorn in 1968 from mixed German - Tadjikistan parentage , Rupp was no newcomer to the Yosemite scene having visited the Valley on a regular basis over the past few years and had completed 10 big wall routes on El Cap .\nHis tally included the first solo and fifth overall ascent of Native Son VI , 5.9 , A4 + to the right of The North America Wall \\/ Gulf Stream routes on the South East Face climbed in 1991 ; in 1992 the sixth ascent of Aurora VI , 5.8 and A5 with Oyvind Moss , and in 1993 the first single-push ascent of Sunkist VI , 5.9 , A4 in 26 hours with Garibotti the route had received less than 10 ascents at the time .\nIn the same year he made a nine hours ascent of the Salath Wall , also with Garibotti .\nPerhaps falling into the category of climbers who have reduced the commitment by drilling for security , is the pair who completed the now controversial Wings of Steel .\nThey were busy drilling on El Cap for over a month , with the drill heard on a daily basis .\nEven a Park ranger was prompted to turn out to discourage their cause .\nThis route seems to avoid any available features , instead taking a blank plum line directly up the wall .\nThe tactics apparently used were to drill small holes into which copperheads could be pasted .\nThe second would then consistently chop the head cables flush with the rock , rendering each placement useless for a subsequent ascent .\nIn contrast , a highly praised event in May , on which no additional drilling appears to have taken place , was the second ascent of the infamous 1987 offering from Randy Leavitt and the late Rob Slater named Scorched Earth .\nChris Kalous and Chris Righter spent five days completing this VI , 5.11 , A5 route .\nThe crux pitch - the Big Brother - involves hard copperheading in rotten rock and a single hook move requiring a device which Leavitt dubbed a Lovetron .\nKalous and Righter also used their version of a Lovetron , a tent pole with a steering wire and a skyhook attached to the end for an extremely long reach .\nLater , Kalous and Rubecca Rusch had made another important second ascent when they spent seven days climbing Bermuda Dunes VI , 5.11 , A4 .\nKalous kept a busy big wall schedule in 1996 .\nIn March he made a solo winter ascent of the Cap , starting up the first eight pitches of Lost in America VI , 5.10 , A5 then making a short traverse on to Tangerine Trip VI , 5.9 , A3 , finishing on the summit after a total of nine days on the face .\nHe and Righter also took their experience to the Cirque of the Unclimbables in the summer and with Kevin Daniels and Gregg Epperson added another hard wall route , Grendel VI , 5.10 , A4 , to Mount Proboscis .\nSadly , the late spring was also the scene of a fatality on El Cap when American , Mathew Baxter , was killed while attempting to solo Zenyatta Mondatta .\nBaxter took what should have been a short fall on the third pitch but his backrope got jammed behind a flake and cut through .\nAfter the spring water had subsided , 17 years old San Francisco climber , Chris Mc Namara , completed Sea of Dreams VI , A5 with Mark Melvin and Wyoming Sheep Ranch VI , A5 with Eric Sloan .\nAnother successful ascent of this last named route was made by Wally Barker .\nReturning from a productive trip to Baffin Island , where with Kohn Rysekchi he completed new routes on Asgard and Friga , Barker despatched the route solo .\nSlovenians added another of the big nail-ups to their tally when Boris Lorencic and Armand Polegek climbed Aurora VI , 5.8 , A5 in six days after fixing the first four pitches .\nEric Kohl , who has established over 20 big wall routes in the Park , most of them solo , added another to the nearby Falls Wall but details are unknown .\nThere were , again , many notable speed ascents of routes on the walls .\nThe prolific team of Dave Bengston , Steve Gerberding and Scott Stowe were , as usual , well-motivated .\nThey began with the first ever continuous ascent of Iron Hawk VI , 5.10 , A4 in 33 hours and 50 minutes .\nTheir next project was a continuous ascent of Lost in America VI , 5.10 , A4 which they despatched in a very rapid 26 hours and 55 minutes .\nThe same three also set a speed record for Lunar Eclipse , completing this line in 23 hours 24 minutes .\nBengston and Stowe then teamed up with Conrad Anker for a record 20 hours and two minutes ascent of Mirage VI , 5.10 , A4 , while Anker , this time with Hans Florine and Mark Melvin reduced the record time for an ascent of the North America Wall to under 24 hours , completing this VI , 5.10 , A3 route in just 21 hours and 48 minutes .\nFlorine and young Chris Mc Namara stomped up the Muir Wall VI , 5.10 , A2 + in a record 23 hours and 24 minutes .\nTwo important solo record ascents were achieved in 1996 .\nArgentinian-born Damien Benegas made an ascent of the classic Zenyatta Mondatta VI , 5.9 , A4 in an unrelenting 37 hours and 30 minutes , while Kevin Thaw took only 20 hours and eight minutes to overcome the often wide cracks of the equally classic West Buttress VI , 5.10 , A3 .\nBenegas has now climbed El Cap wall routes on more than 50 occasions , a total of ascents possibly only beaten by the prolific Steve Gerberding , who has now climbed the captain on well over 70 occasions .\nHaving warmed up by climbing the Regular Route on Half Dome see below and making an ascent of Zodiac , American resident Abby Watkins and fellow Australian , Vera Wong , beat Nancy Feagin and Sue Mc Devitt s all female record for The Nose , lowering the time to 16 hours and 30 minutes .\nThe pair began the route at 5am on the 26th September and had to climb over and around six other parties before reaching the top .\nFinally , 1996 also marked the third all free ascent of the Salath .\nThis time it was the turn of Thomas Huber , brother to Alex who made the well-publicized second ascent .\nThomas led all the pitches including the 19th 5.13 a and the two 5.13 b pitches on the headwall .\nHalf Dome In July , Peter Coward and the well-known Valley speed climber , Hans Florine , achieved the remarkable feat of linking the Regular and Direct Routes on the North West Face in a single day .\nThe Direct was climbed in a record 12 hours and the Regular in three hours and 42 minutes .\nThis inspired various other fast ascents on the wall and in mid - August Coward and Florine returned , driving from San Francisco , climbing the Regular Route in just one minute over three hours and driving back in under 24 hours .\nThe all-women s record for this route was also beaten last year when the Australians , Abby Watkins and Vera Wong , climbed the route in just nine hours and 45 minutes .\nWong and Willy Benegas also reportedly completed the Direct Route in 11 hours and 45 minutes .\nThe last word , however , came on Friday the 13th of September , when the well-known Slovenian , Silvo Karo , teamed up with Aischan Rupp making his second short trip to the Valley last year to climb the Direct in probably a new record time of 11 hours and 20 minutes .\nThe pair felt that this time could easily be improved , as conditions for the ascent were far from ideal .\nHalfway up the route it started to rain and this turned to snow near the top ... INFO Dave Pegg \\/ Aischan Rupp \\/ Kevin Thaw North American Ice Colorado In parallel to the tremendous activity in Europe this winter , which successfully appears to have raised the technical standards of the new-wave mixed climbing reported in the next issue , America has also seen its share of impressive performances in 1997 and there is now a definite trend towards working and redpointing short , difficult mixed problems .\nThe big breakthrough of the season was Will Gadd s route Amphibian , a two-pitch , bolt protected line in the near vicinity of Octopussy at the laboratory of Vail .\nAfter considerable time and effort bolting the route from above , Gadd worked on the line for three weeks before making a clean lead of every section .\nThe route is a little over 50m long , with the top overhanging the base by around 15m .\nIt has two pitches , the first of which Gadd , a noted Canadian sport climber , redpointed at the beginning of March and the second , somewhat harder pitch a week or so later .\nHowever , he was apparently unable climb the entire route in one complete ascent .\nA rating of M9 or even M9 + placed it in a new league of mixed climbing and made it a full grade harder than test pieces such as Octopussy .\nThe first pitch , which is around 22m in length and graded 9 - , climbs an overhanging rock wall on which there is absolutely no ice whatsoever .\nThe second involves a start on ice followed by two horizontal roofs of about 6m each and separated by an icicle at the top of which it is possible to get a good rest , then more ice above the roofs to reach the top .\nQuickly on the scene was Stevie Haston .\nThis was Haston s second visit to the USA to climb ice during the winter , the first involving attendance at the ESPN ice climbing competition set up by Jeff Lowe , and the Ouray Ice Festival .\nHaston has spent almost six months this winter concentrating solely on his ice\\/mixed climbing , on average three and sometimes five days a week .\nThis appears to have paid off with a remarkable series of new routes , details of which will appear in the next issue when we review the European Alpine winter .\nOn his first visit in January \\/ February he repeated Jeff Lowe s hard mixed route of 1996 , Resurrection .\nThis is a typical Vail climb , overcoming seriously impending rock to reach a free hanging icicle .\nLowe placed protection no bolts on aid then worked the route like a sport climb .\nHe felt it had a longer series of moves than Octopussy in its original condition but was about the same order of technical difficulty .\nHe rated it M8 .\nHaston flashed it , finding it an excellent though complex mixed climb and felt it to be 8 - \\/ 8 .\nOver in the Ice Park of Ouray , Haston climbed a scary 7\\/7 + which in some ways he felt was the hardest thing he did all winter .\nThe route took a slender , tapering hanging icicle that was only possible to climb by hooking and hugging .\nIt was top roped first as it was initially thought too fragile for a complete ascent .\nThe Box Canyon at Ouray was home to around 450 climbers and an equal number of spectators for the Festival .\nAs reported in a previous INFO , pure ice climbs are artificially created here using sprinkler valves on a large waterpipe that runs around the rim .\nThough most climbs are top roped , the routes still make very fine leads .\nThese half or one pitch climbs can be changed at will well , in about three days to a week and the atmosphere is very friendly with the town encouraging climbing and giving discounts to visiting climbers .\nMany of these visitors are now performing at a very high standard , reaching grade 6 after just a few weekends .\nNotable routes are Bloody Sunday 7 by Mark Wilford and a second route at the same grade by Will Gadd and his usual partner on the ice , the prolific resident climber from Iceland , Helgi Christensen .\nHaston s second visit to the USA appears to have been even more productive .\nNow at his strongest ever , he first repeated Pete Takeda s recent route , Fat Man and Robin , originally worked over several days .\nThe route involves a three metre overhang and was graded 9 - by the first ascensionists .\nHaston came close to flashing it and on his subsequent ascent felt that in reality it was probably only 8 + .\nFat Man and Robin is another line in the immediate vicinity of The Fang and Octopussy at Vail , starting with the usual section of overhanging rock leading to a stalactite with the crux roof at the top .\nAmphibian took him two days .\nOn the first session Haston had to resort to rest points on the top pitch but completed it clean on the second day .\nThe first pitch was thought to be 8 + rather than 9 - .\nThe initial roof on the second pitch he found to be quite juggy and he did it without ice tools or gloves where possible this does less damage to the rock and Gadd had taken a fall here when an axe placement broke .\nThe second he climbed at 9 - .\nHaston s feeling is that the leading American climbers are making very real but smaller progress than was first thought and the top grade is being expanded somewhat disproportionately .\nHe also feels that his new routes Welcome to the Machine and 009 in Italy s Val Savaranche , now possibly the first genuine M9s in the world , have harder and more powerful moves and equally more demanding and fragile ice , though are not as long as the routes at Vail .\nBefore leaving the USA Haston turned his overworked arms to the desert sandstone and became the first person to climb one of the main Fisher Towers without aid when he spent three days cleaning , working and then free climbing Echo Tower by the line of Phantom Spirit .\nThe hard mixed routes being put up in Europe at present , of which Trait de Lune , a 40m high unconfirmed M8 + in the eastern region of Switzerland s Jura mountains by the well-known German Alpinist , Robert Jasper , is another example , need crampons to both start and finish the climbing Jasper s route includes an impressive bulge climbed free with bare hands , crampons and the somewhat limiting effect of full winter clothing and still thought to be around F7a + \\/ 7b .\nAmphibian , in contrast , has a first pitch that is entirely on rock .\nIt may now be time to re-assess what proportion of pure , un-iced rock should exist on a route in order for it to still be considered a mixed climb , even by American standards .\nThe potential for climbing long rock walls to reach small hanging icicles is still vast and dry tooling is all the rage .\nCertain climbers had suggested taking their axes and crampons to the sport cliff of Rifle until they were made to realize the damage such an act would do to existing rock climbs .\nNewcomer , Gary Ryan , also felt he had made a breakthrough by climbing Blade Runner at the popular Loch Vale area in Rocky Mountain National Park .\nThis route ascends 18m of overhanging granite to reach a thin ice curtain leading 12m to the top and is situated very close to several other recently created mixed routes .\nRyan , brother of the British rock-climber Tony Ryan and now an American resident , placed three bolts plus four pegs then began working Blade Runner in late February .\nOn one of his attempts he had almost reached the top and was pulling on a small tree root when it snapped , resulting in a spectacular fall .\nRyan finally redpointed the route on the 5th March , giving it a rating of M9 .\nSubsequent appraisal by certain other climbers and a flashed second ascent by Will Gadd confirmed that the standard was no more than M8 .\nRyan s subsequent failure to climb Resurrection seems to bear this out .\nHowever , Ryan , a very strong climber , undoubtedly did make a meteoric impact on the climbing world , taking to the ice for the first time after 18 years of rock-climbing .\nHe quickly on sighted Secret Probation M7 at Vail and then went on to make only the second on sight ascent of Octopussy .\nOther routes include a repeat of David Sheldon s Free Strike Zone M7 + and a new route at Ouray , Easter Rising , which he gave a grade of M8 + , though this again is now widely believed to be somewhat over rated .\nWith the potential at Vail drying up , other venues are now being examined .\nAt Glenwood Canyon , Gadd and Jeff Lowe climbed Deep Throat , a five star 7 + that apart from a few metres of rock in its 45m length is entirely on ice .\nAnother M8 has also been reported , this time in the Cascade Canyon region of the state , where Big Wall climber Jared Ogden and partner climbed Against the Grain .\nThe route actually followed the line of a hard , but yet to be redpointed , F7b bolted rock-climbing project , negotiating a roof to reach ice above .\nThere have been attempts recently to equate ice to rock grades in order to try to answer the question as to what level mixed climbing is at relative to rock Gadd felt that Amphibian felt equivalent to a 5.13 sport climb .\nAlthough it is obviously impossible to make a direct comparison , the following consensus at present gives a very rough indication of the physical difficulty involved with making an ascent of a short , hard but well-protected route such as those found at Vail M6 = 5.10 + or F6b + or well-protected E3 M7 = 5.11 or 6b + to 7a or well-protected E5 M8 = 5.12 or 7a + to 7b + M9 = 5.12 to 5.13 or 7c to 8a M10 = 8a + to 8b + ?\nINFO Stevie Haston \\/ Gary Ryan Search All site News Events Features Training Travel High Mountain Sports On The Edge for On The Edge Magazine | Outdoor Industry Jobs | Customer Information\nHigh Mountain Info July 1997\nbolivia@ozono.bo\nbolivia',105

Cleaning Polluted Urban Lands Could Bring $ 7 Billion Benefit Crumbling warehouses , rusting refineries and abandoned gas stations represent a major economic opportunity for Canada , says a federal study .\nCleaning up an estimated 30,000 so-called brownfields in cities and towns could bring $ 7 billion in benefits , the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy says in a report released Monday .\nFor example , restoring brownfields in Toronto would probably bring an extra $ 100 million in annual tax revenue , said Angus Ross , one of the study s authors .\nThe report does not estimate costs of cleaning up the thousands of polluted sites .\nA brownfield is an abandoned , vacant or derelict site , contaminated by past industrial activity .\nLoans , grants and regulatory changes are needed to encourage remediation of such sites across Canada , says the report .\nBrownfields damage a neighborhoods image and quality of life and represent a major loss of economic opportunity , says the report .\nRestoring them would create jobs , increase tax revenues , reduce commuting times and ease pressure to develop cropland , wooded areas and recreational land around cities .\nBrownfield redevelopment in Canada has the potential to bring billions and billions and billions of dollars in economic benefits , said David Mc Guinty , president of the federal research body .\n-- Public Memorial Held for Students Killed in Avalanche CALGARY AP - A final farewell to seven teenaged classmates killed in an avalanche 10 days ago paid tribute Monday to their adventurous spirits and the void left by their deaths .\nNever in our wildest dreams could we have imagined that any single community would be asked to withstand such an overwhelming burden of grief in a single stroke , said Tony Macoun , headmaster at Strathcona - Tweedsmuir , a small private school located just south of Calgary near Okotoks .\nMacoun was joined by hundreds of mourners at the Pengrowth Saddledome in remembering the seven Grade 10 students who were killed Feb. 1 when a concrete-like wall of snow crashed down upon them during a backcountry ski trip near Revelstoke , British Columbia Among the guests were Alberta Premier Ralph Klein and British Columbia mountain guides Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall , who are credited with saving at least five of the 10 survivors of the slide .\nThe emotional memorial followed a week of funerals for the teens , who were heralded for their accomplishments , their compassion and their love of life .\nTears flowed often as mourners recalled Ben Albert , Daniel Arato , Scott Broshko , Alex Pattillo , Michael Shaw , Marissa Staddon and Jeff Trickett .\nAll were 15 .\nWe have lost seven students , but also seven future leaders , seven great adventurers and seven brilliant young people , said Macoun , noting that the school s loss pales in comparison with that of the families .\nThis has indeed been an impossible week of sorrow .\n-- Need for Child Care Vastly Outstripped by Availability TORONTO AP - Quebec is leaving the rest of the country in the dust when it comes to child care and early childhood education spending , a report released Monday reveals .\nBut while the authors applauded Quebec s efforts , they were quick to point out it s not that the province is doing such a spectacular job in providing day-care funding .\nRather , the rest of the country is doing a dismal job of it .\nIf you look at Quebec since they started developing the new program , they ve put in a huge number of spaces .\nNow do I think it s exactly been done right ?\nWell no , I don t really .\nBut it s been done in the right ballpark , said Martha Friendly , one of the report s authors .\nYou can t make it spring up from nothing .\nYou have to have people and you have to have places to put it and all that stuff .\nAnd the problem is the rest of Canada has not started essentially .\nThe report was produced by the childcare resource and research unit of the University of Toronto , a group which Friendly heads .\nThe report , which is based on data from 2001 , is the fourth looking at the early childhood education and care sector in the country .\nEarlier reports were released in 1992 , 1995 and 1998 .\nThe latest shows that spending on child care outside of Quebec has actually decreased over the past decade , dropping by about $ 70 million in 2001 constant dollars .\nemail this print this News | Business | Sports | Entertainment | Living | Shop Local | Classifieds | Jobs | Cars | Homes About Ledger -

In the Shadow of the Chief film screening , a reconstruction of the first ascent of the Squamish Chief ; and more films .\nThe evening is presented by Mount Seymour .\nWhere Centennial Theatre , 2300 Lonsdale Avenue , North Vancouver exit 18 off Trans Canada Highway When Friday February 27 , 7 00 doors open and reception starts at 6 00 PM .\nTickets $ 15 in advance , $ 17 at the door .\nAdvance tickets available at MEC , selected outdoor stores and climbing gyms , and at the Centennial Theatre Box Office , 604 984-4484 .\n------------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP Show + Ticket Info Centennial Theatre Fri Feb 27 , 7pm Tickets 604 984-4484 Chic Scott It has been forty years since Chic Scott discovered the magic of high places .\nDuring a lifetime of adventure he has climbed and skied around the world , organized clubs and foundations , written books and worked as a mountain guide .\nHis odyssey has taken him from the icefields of the Canadian Rockies to the historic climbs of the European Alps , from the grandeur of the Himalayas to the icy solitude of Mount Logan .\nIn all seasons , on foot and on skis he has followed his passion .\nSome of his major adventures over the years have been a first winter ascent of Mount Assiniboine 1967 , the first Jasper to Lake Louise High Level Ski Traverse 1967 , the Aiguille du Dru North Face in the French Alps 1973 , and Myagdi Matha 1973 - the first Himalayan summit reached by a Canadian .\nHis guidebook Summits and Icefields is a classic of the genre , while Pushing the Limits , the Story of Canadian Mountaineering , is considered the authority on the subject .\nIn recent years Chic has received several awards - honorary memberships in the Association of Canadian Mountain Guides 1995 , the Calgary Mountain Club 1997 and The Alpine Club of Canada 2000 , and the Bill March Summit of Excellence Award 2000 .\nHis magnum opus Pushing the Limits , the story of Canadian Mountaineering has won four awards including Alberta Trade Book of the Year , and the Wilfred Eggleston Award for Non Fiction .\nChic now resides in Cochrane , Alberta where he earns his living writing books and magazine articles and giving slide shows on mountain topics .\nWhen not at his computer Chic can be found hiking , skiing , or climbing in the nearby Rocky Mountains , or perhaps sitting around the fire at one of the ACC huts telling stories .\nJoin Chic Scott on his VIMFF voyage of ski discovery Powder Paradise , Backcountry Skiing in Western Canada and discover the classic backcountry ski destinations of Western Canada .\nEnjoy beautiful and exciting images of powder skiing at Rogers Pass , nordic touring in the Rockies , solitude on the Freshfield Icefield , magnificent glaciers on Mount Waddington in the Coast Mountains and the icy heights of a ski ascent of Mount Logan .\nCanada has some of the best backcountry skiing in the world most of it unknown and uncrowded .\nAlso on the same evening screening of VIMFF 2004 back country ski films .\nWhere Planetarium Mac Millan Space Centre , 1100 Chestnut Street , Vancouver South End of Burrard Bridge When Tuesday February 24 , 7 00 doors open and reception starts at 6 00 PM .\nTickets $ 12 at the door ------------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP Show + Ticket Info Planetarium Tue Feb 24 , 7pm Tickets $ 12 at door John Verm Sherman John Verm Sherman is an American Icon among climbers and has left his mark on the world of bouldering .\nFrom developing hundreds of boulder problems in Hueco Tanks , climbing over 15 thousand different boulder problems in his 29 years long climbing career including early repeats of the rock climbing milestones of The Thimble and Midnight Lightning , to developing the V V is for Verm bouldering grade , designing the first commercially available crash pad The Kinnaloa Sketchpad , to being a writer for Climbing Magazine John continues to push the envelope of high-ball bouldering and society norms .\nHe has climbed in every state , written profusely on everything from desert sandstone , to bagging carpet strips at the base of boulders , to the sexual dysfuction of climbing magazine editors .\nHe has also written three books Stone Crusade , the Bible on the history and development of bouldering in America ; Sherman Exposed , a slightly censored collection of his best and funniest stories ; and unfortunately prostituted himself with the self help book , Better Bouldering , for dorks who don t know better .\nVerm is one of the bravest , no-holds-barred , funniest , pull-no-punches-journos that the climbing community has ever experienced .\nHe is a rare breed fat , extremely good-looking for a sheep shagger , he can boulder quite well , hates Christian Griffiths , with Russ Walling and Dick Cilley , and is a self-promotor extraordinaire .\nBut at all times he must be treated with kid gloves .\nHis ego , his joints , and his tendons , are fragile .\nVerm on a boulderer getting old You don t worry so much about getting fat .\nEspecially when you find out that chicks half your age dig having something to grab on to .\nThe bummer is all the injuries coming back to haunt you .\nBeing an old boulderer is very painful .\nHowever , I don t plan to panic until my joints get stiffer than my johnson .\nVerm on his favorite climbing model Laetitia Casta - now there is finally something superb coming out of France !\nI say the French invented pulling on gear and calling it freeclimbing .\nI ll admit they played around on the boulders at Fontainebleau and guys like Pierre Allain did some cool stuff , but I still credit John Gill with inventing modern bouldering .\nHe was the first to pursue bouldering as a gymnastic pursuit and to view the boulders as gymnastic apparatus .\nHe was also the first to actively seek out problems which could only be climbed dynamically .\nOn Sherman Exposed Outrageous , talented , and a force to be reckoned with , John Sherman is always willing to spout an opinion that s sure to raise eyebrows .\nThis rowdy collection of biting satire , parody profiles , barely restrained rants , and genuine reflections on climbing s unsung heroes is no different .\nBlending his juiciest Verm s World columns from Climbing magazine with previously unpublished or , perhaps , unpublishable ?\nstories , Sherman pulls no punches , even on himself .\nFrom his college exploits in buildering on the Berkeley campus , to his quest for the Fab 50 , to his years as a nomadic boulderer , Sherman shares the best , and the worst , he has found in the people and places he encountered along the way .\nClimbers will discover valuable excuse-making techniques in The Dog Ate My Belay Plate ; they will aspire to the very un - PC All Vermin Team ; and they will challenge themselves with The Verm s World History Aptitude Test .\nWho could ask for more ?\nOn the recent news of Verm getting married My dog Thimble and I have shared a common address for 7 + years now - that constitutes a common law marriage in Colorado .\nIt would be bigamy for me to marry another .\nI suppose I could move to Utah .\nVerm s famous bouldering scale V0 A problem you wouldn t admit to doing no matter how cool it was .\nV1 A problem you would admit to doing , if it had loose holds , a death landing , and your partner backed off of it .\nV2 A problem , if cool enough , that you would recommend to others to prove you re not a ratings snob .\nV3 A problem you ruthlessly wire and incorporate into your warm-up routine , in the hopes that visiting partners will struggle on it .\nV4 A problem that might give you trouble , but Hey , anything below V5 is so easy I can t tell the difference .\nV5 A problem , if you were to live in Boulder , Colorado , that you might actually flash .\nV6 A problem , if you were to live in Boulder , Colorado , that you would expect your girlfriend to flash .\nV7 A problem you fell on repeatedly , but really , you could have flashed it .\nV8 A problem you religiously avoid , because you re saving it for the flash .\nV9 A problem you have no chance of flashing .\nV10 A problem you knew you could have done , even though your spotter took 10kg off for you , so you counted it anyway .\nV11 A problem , if flashed , that you might get free shoes for , but only if you fax the mags this month .\nV12 A problem you would do if only your fingers were a bit smaller , your reach a bit longer , your spotter more attentive , the weather more amenable , your shoes not so blown out , your elbow not so sore from training , the sun not in your eyes , and you didn t eat that funky take-out Chinese the night before .\nV13 A problem commensurate with your well-published abilities , that you deserve credit for , even though you didn t do it , because as the mags reported , It was too humid .\nV14 A problem only Fred Nicole could do , after you gave him the beta .\nJoin Verm in his VIMFF show The Fab 50 - John Verm Sherman s preposterous quest to climb in all 50 states en route experiencing the best and worst climbing the US has to offer .\nIt s about an hour long and follows Verm s quest to be first to rock climb in all 50 states of the US .\nHence it explores the best and worst climbing America has to offer , from the big walls of Yosemite to the swamps of Florida .\nIt s fairly tongue-in-cheek as such a quest is pretty ridiculous in the first place , but it does make for lots of good stories and proves that if you want climb bad enough you ll find something to scale .\nAlso on the same evening a program on recent bouldering development in Squamish , BC ; VIMFF bouldering and rock climbing films ; Share A Pint With Verm community educational program - Verm s favorite ales are Pilsner Urquell , La Fin du Monde , King Cobra , Franziskaner Dunkel - Weizen , Sierra Nevada Pale Ale , Salvator , Anchor Porter , Cooper s Best Extra Stout , Old Rasputin .\nWhere Centennial Theatre , 2300 Lonsdale Avenue , North Vancouver exit 18 off Trans Canada Highway When Saturday February 28 , 7 00 doors open and reception starts at 6 00 PM .\nTickets $ 15 in advance , $ 17 at the door .\nAdvance tickets available at MEC , selected outdoor stores and climbing gyms , and at the Centennial Theatre Box Office , 604 984-4484 .\n------------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP Show + Ticket Info Centennial Theatre Sat Feb 28 , 7pm Tickets 604 984-4484 Abby Watkins Nothing in the life of Abby Watkins has been typical .\nSince she began climbing in 1988 , Abby has proven her ability to excel at just about every kind of climbing imaginable .\nIn 1996 she and fellow Australian Vera Wong set the Women s Speed Records on the Nose of El Cap 16 hrs .\n30 min .\nand the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome 9 hrs .\n45 minutes .\nShe also has a mile-long list of competitive titles she s taken home over the years third place at the 2002 Ice Climbing World Championships , first place at Festiglace du Quebec in 2001 , first place at the Ouray Ice Festival in the combined category , the U. S. Speed Climbing Championship in 1996 .\nYet among all her achievements , Abby remains fully grounded , The most important thing for me has not been the end results , the wins , the records .\nI am far more interested in the relationships I have created through climbing , and also the humility with which climbing has helped me approach the world .\nIn 1998 Abby took her skills to the mountains of Pakistan and promptly completed two first ascents in the Nangmah Valley .\nHer ability to set numerous speed-climbing records , on-sight 5.12 , lead grade 6 ice and M8 + mixed routes has proven that she s virtually unstoppable when it comes to climbing .\nPerhaps her background as a dancer and gymnast has helped to fuel her fire , or it could be her raw talent and flair for adventure that allows her to continually build upon her talents and add to her repertoire of successes .\nBut any way you look at it , you ll find Abby sharing her talent and experiences through her presentations and clinics , and her job as a mountain guide .\nJoin Abby Watkins in her VIMFF presentation Climbing - A Woman s Perspective for a journey of climbing from the sun-drenched cliffs of her homeland , Australia to towering big walls of Yosemite , from the Karakoram to Kirov , Russia and beyond .\nNever one to want to miss out on anything , her climbing career has taken her through rock climbing , ice climbing , big wall speed climbing records , alpine climbing , first ascents in the Karakoram and competing in the ice climbing World Cup .\nWith the unique perspective of a woman engaging in a life of high adventure , Abby will speak of her life on the sharp end of the rope .\nAbby s presentation is sponsored by the North Face .\nAlso on the same evening Matt Maddaloni s multimedia presentation Squamish Long Free Routes covering his recent breakthrough ascents in the area of Squamish ;

first ascent of a 8000m peak in one day Broad Peak , 1984 , 16 hours up and 6 hours down , solo ; a few new routes on the highest peaks , many of them climbed solo ; 3 first winter ascents of the highest peaks Everest , Kangchenjunga , and Lhotse .\nWielicki , together with the famous Polish expedition leader Andrzej Zawada , originated the idea of climbing in the Himalayas in the winter .\nHe also climbed the obligatory and so well medialized all fourteen 8-thousanders , as well as the 7 highest peaks of each continent - but then , you in a way expect something like that from a stubborn Pole a proud member of the Art of Suffering movement Wielicki s list of climbing credentials with his 8000 meter peak notes may actually appear longer - and to an outside observer more boring and drier - than Adam Szienkiewicz s oeuvres all combined , however , a closer insight reveals a very passionate , interesting personality .\nWielicki s Bildung in the Art of Suffering started at the early age .\nDuring his first climbing season he crashed down and broke three of his lumbar vertebras .\nAt the clinic , they stuffed him into a plaster corset up to his neck .\nThe only problem was , his brother was getting married and their mother simply couldn t know that he was climbing at all , not to mention the hospital , his injury , corset and all .\nFor his brother s wedding , he had to be there , and so he cut the plaster with a knife edge and escaped from the hospital through the balcony and roof .\nHis friends had brought him clothes and nobody discovered anything .\nMany accidents followed , but the will to climb was stronger .\nThose climbing survival stories Wielicki s name is associated above all with the first winter ascent of Everest , yet Wielicki got to the expedition from a reserve list .\nFor Andrzej Zawada , the head of the expedition , he was but a greenhorn - he was only 29 years old and this was his first major expedition to the high ranges .\nThe history of this expedition is fairly well known in short , Wielicki reached the summit with Leszek Cichy .\nInterestingly , one could say that Wielicki started his Himalayan career from the rear end , from the highest mountain in the most extreme conditions He was a member of Solidarnosc , the Polish underground party , escaping the officials , destroying and hiding secret documents , and being interrogated by the state police .\nHe went to Alaska and earned some decent money by working hard as a fish gutter .\nThat was his first contact with capitalism , a really dreadful experience , since it was the first time he had experienced fierce competition at the workplace .\nThen there came a period of working at heights , when there were two doctors and one assistant professor hanging on one chimney .\nWielicki painted almost the whole of his native Silesia .\nTo this day he shows his children where their daddy painted the Katowice steelworks , mines , buildings , conveyor belts , chimneys of heat-generating plants , water towers ... from Trzebnia to Zabrze .\nPerhaps harder than climbing Everest in the winter , capitalism and fighting with the state police was Wielicki s solo Nanga Parbat climb in 1996 .\nAfter climbing K2 in the summer of 1996 he went on to solo Nanga Parbat directly afterwards .\nHe was all alone , just him and the mountain .\nThis was when I was the most scared ever .\nIn the most recent years Wielicki was pushing for the first winter ascent of K2 making two notable attempts in 2002 and 2003 with a strong international team , getting always quite high but never to the top .\nIn the vein of the great Polish romantic writers Wielicki secretly dreams about Polish climbers being the first people on all the world s highest peaks in the winter time .\nWielicki is a Renaissance man of the mountains - any mountain , any style , solo or with friends , any season , home made crampons or top gear , you name it and Krzysztof can do it .\nIf he doesn t make it the first time , you bet he be seen there one year later A man of amazing human strength , both physical and mental .\nNever stop climbing is his motto , pushing on even when it hurts , but also knowing when it is time to turn around .\nI will never stop climbing ; because we should always try to make new and different goals - this is the key for mountaineering .\nWielicki s VIMFF presentation will cover his life time journey of a world class alpine climber and mountaineer , as well as many hair raising stories from his climbs , both censored and uncensored .\nAlso on the same evening Simon Yates from Britain in a slide show The Good , the Bad and the Beautiful ; film festival awards ; and screening of some of the festival winning films .\nWhere Centennial Theatre , 2300 Lonsdale Avenue , North Vancouver exit 18 off Trans Canada Highway When Sunday February 29 , 7 00 doors open and reception starts at 6 00 PM .\nTickets $ 15 in advance , $ 17 at the door .\nAdvance tickets available at MEC , selected outdoor stores and climbing gyms , and at the Centennial Theatre Box Office , 604 984-4484 .\n------------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP Show + Ticket Info Centennial Theatre Sun Feb 29 , 7pm Tickets 604 984-4484 Simon Yates In a career spanning eighteen years Simon Yates climbing and traveling has taken him from Alaska in the east to Australia in the west , from the Canadian Arctic in the north to the tip of South America .\nDuring this time he has been fortunate enough to climb with some of Britain s most influential contemporary mountaineers including among many Mick Fowler , Andy Parkin , Paul Pritchard , Doug Scott , Sean Smith and Steve Sustad .\nSimon has made ten visits to the Pakistani Karakoram , climbing numerous peaks .\nThese have included first ascents of Leyla Peak 6300m and Nemeka 6400m in Hushe , a second ascent of Lobsang 2 on the Baltoro and various 6000m peaks on the Hispar glacier .\nIn other parts of the world , Simon has succeeded with a team making the first British ascent of Khan Tengri 6995m in Kazakhstan and for a time concentrated on big wall climbing in Patagonia and Baffin Island - the most notable achievement , a new route on the Central Tower of Paine in Chile .\nSimon almost succeeded making the first ascent of Makrong Chhish 6608m on the Hispar glacier in Pakistan in 1996 and in 1997 reached 8300m on Lhotse the world s forth-highest mountain .\nMost recently 2001 and 2003 Simon has made two sailing and mountaineering trips to Chilean Tierra del Fuego resulting in the first ascent of Monte Ada 2100m and the third ascent of Monte Frances 2200m .\nIn addition to climbing for himself Simon has successfully guided clients to the summits of peaks such as Ama Dablam 6856m in Nepal , Aconcagua 6960m in Argentina and Marble Wall 6400m and Khan Tengri 6995m in Kazakhstan .\nSimon s first book - Against The Wall was published to critical acclaim in 1997 and was runner up in The Boardman Tasker Award for mountain literature .\nHis second book The Flame of Adventure was published in November 2001 and was short-listed for a prize in the prestigious Banff Mountain Book Festival .\nIn his VIMFF lecture and slide presentation The Good , the Bad and the Beautiful Simon will take a humorous and philosophical look at some of the more notable experiences over his years as a mountaineer , accompanied by a stunning selection of slides collected during his travels .\nAlso on the same evening Krzysztof Wielicki from Poland , one of the most accomplished high-altitude climbers , with a program on his major Himalayan climbs , including the first winter ascent of Everest ;

'What is an Avalanche ?\nSnow is deposited in successive layers as the winter progresses .\nThese layers may have dissimilar physical properties and an avalanche occurs when one layer slides on another Surface Avalanche , or the whole snow cover slides on the ground Full - Depth .\nAn avalanche may be Dry or Wet , according to whether free water is present in the snow .\nIt may be of Loose Snow , when the avalanche starts at a single point , or a Slab Avalanche , which occurs when an area of more cohesive snow separates from the surrounding snow and slides out .\nThey Couldn t Get Out of the Way By the time they wake Saturday morning , Parks Canada will have already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers .\nIn tree-line and alpine areas , the avalanche risk has been assessed as considerable , the mid-range of the five possible ratings .\nBelow the tree-line , the risk is assessed as moderate , with natural avalanches unlikely .\nAnd the group of 14 high school students and three adults intend to stay below the tree line throughout their expedition .\nBut the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize .\nThe group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building , a macaroni-shaped structure with a sod and timber roof , to pore over the latest information .\nMr. Nicholson goes inside .\nHe asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher and a chaperone .\nThe group decides it is safe to ski that day .\nThey ski through forest , along a rocky creek , over a snow-covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley .\nSurrounded by mountains and deep powder snow , the scenery is breathtaking .\nReminders of past avalanches are everywhere .\nFoliage is sparse on the valley floor .\nThe school group successfully crosses four avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley , and three on the south side .\nIt s a soft , gray morning .\nThe ground is blanketed by eight centimetres of fresh snow .\nThe temperature hovers around zero .\nThe past 24 hours have been avalanche-free , and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia .\nThey are not alone .\nThe mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass .\nHusband and wife pause to say hello .\nIt s a beautiful day out here , isn t it ?\nsays Abby .\nYes , someone responds .\nThey leave the 14 teenagers and three adults behind , climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area .\nAt that very moment , just before noon , something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain .\nAbby and Rich hear a thunderous roar .\nThey watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley , picking up speed and debris .\nThe school group is directly in its path .\nRich screams Avalanche !\nAvalanche !\nAvalanche !\nThe skiers look up .\nThe guide s frantic warning comes too late .\nThe avalanche hits them head on .\nIn a matter of seconds , all 17 skiers are swept away in a huge , terrifying tangle of snow , rocks and trees .\nThe swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds , Abby thinks .\nA huge roar .\nThe power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way .\n.\n.\n.\nNobody could have got out of the way .\nNobody .\nStudents mourn the loss of their friends The river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers , then separates them .\nA section of the slide breaks away and keeps going , carrying a number of victims hundreds of metres down the valley .\nDisoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to swim to the surface , this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 metres beneath the concrete-hard snow .\nUp in the trees , Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are dusted by a thick cloud of powder .\nA terrible silence falls over the valley .\nThough their hearts are thumping , they shut down their emotions .\nOn goes the search-and-rescue switch , one they have trained for years to put into practice .\nThey race down to the first group of buried skiers .\nThe only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow .\nThe others , in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley , are buried much deeper .\nAlone at the scene , the husband-and-wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions .\nWho to save first ?\nNot everybody would make it , they reason .\nBut those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival .\nRich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging .\nFor the next 45 minutes , except for the victims , Rich and Abby are there by themselves , working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow .\nThe guides transceivers work perfectly , honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons , like shouts from the grave .\nThe couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork .\nOnly dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing .\nClear snow from the victim s face .\nNo CPR before moving on to the next victim .\nThere are too many .\nLet survivors dig themselves out .\nThe victims are scattered beneath the snow .\nRich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible .\nThe first five people they pull out survive .\nThose survivors go on to rescue others .\nEveryone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead .\nThe grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over .\nSeven students make it .\nSeven do not .\nOne survivor , with a broken ankle , is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital .\nThe remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden s station .\nThe bodies go too .\nThey are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building .\nChuck Purse , Revelstoke s part-time coroner , is investigating his second seven-death avalanche within two weeks .\nHe examines each body in turn .\nNone show signs of major injury .\nThey were simply swept away , buried and died from asphyxiation .\nLoose snow tumbles down the mountain A slab avalanche breaks off the mountain A car is swept away by a tidal wave of snow What Do I Do If ...\nI GET CAUGHT In most avalanche situations , any defensive action is very difficult .\nMovement relative to the debris is often impossible .\nHowever , some of the following may be useful Try to delay departure by plunging an ice axe into the undersurface .\nThis may help to keep you near the top of the slide Shout .\nOthers may see you .\nTry to run to the side , or jump up-slope above the fracture If hard slab , try to remain on top of a block .\nGet rid of gear ; sacks , skis etc. .\nTry to roll like a log , off the debris .\nSwimming motions sometimes help .\nAs the avalanche slows down , you may be able to get some purchase on the debris .\nMake a desperate effort to get to the surface , or at least get a hand through .\nI M BURIED Keep one hand in front of you face and try to clear\\/maintain an air space .\nTry to maintain space for chest expansion by taking and holding a deep breath .\nTry to avoid panic and conserve energy .\nYour companions are probably searching for you .\nTry to dig yourself out if you are unhurt .\nThe next number that works against you is the length of burial .\nA speedy location and recovery of the buried victim is essential as the survival rate drops to 50 \% after 20 minutes .\nAn avalanche occurs on Mt.\nEverest .\nA mountain climber treads carefully .\nSkiiers are particularly vulnerable to triggering an avalanche , as the lateral motion releases unstable snow .\nAvalanche Rescue Equipment The best strategy for surviving an avalanche is to avoid being caught in one .\nAll backcountry skiers and boarders should be trained in avalanche awareness and should be knowledgeable about the conditions and terrain they re entering .\nThe following rescue equipment should be in everyone s backpack and the skills for using it should be readily accessible in everyone s head Transceivers Avalanche transceivers also known as beacons are designed to help a rescuer locate a buried victim in the least amount of time possible .\nAlthough most beacons in use today are fairly intuitive to operate , it is important to practice using them on a regular basis .\nProbes The only way to penetrate dense , compacted avalanche debris is to use a multi-sectioned aluminium pole known as an avalanche probe .\nThey extend two to three metres long , and are held in tension with a cable .\nWhen a searcher with a beacon has honed in on a buried person , other members of the party should probe the snowpack for the exact location of the victim .\nYou can not pinpoint a person who is deeply buried using only a beacon .\nThe probe is left in contact with the victim until they have been exposed by shovelling .\nProbes also have other uses , such as checking snowpack depth , and testing crevasse bridges and cornices while traveling .\nFor this reason , they are currently carried by most travellers and are recommended over probe poles .\nShovels Finding the location of a victim is only the first part of the rescue digging them out is the second critical step .\nIn the seconds after an avalanche , even fresh powder will solidify so densely that you can not push your hand into it .\nThere are many different types of avalanche shovels .\nThe more high-tech models have telescoping handles that extend to give better leverage when shovelling .\nSome store saws or probes in their handles .\nMetal blades chop debris better than lexan or polycarbonate , and the bigger the blade , the more snow you can move with each scoop .\nThe important thing about shovels is that everybody in your group has one .\nIt is also worth practising excavation in a team of two or three to learn to shovel effectively as a group .\nBeautiful Roger s Pass , B. C. is the site of a tragic accident that claimed the lives of 7 students .\nAvalanches claimed the lives of 28 Canadians in 2002-2003 .\nThat number declined in 2003-2004 to 10 fatalities Sliding Into Oblivion Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau s youngest son , Michel , was killed in an avalanche in 1998 No one knows how quickly Michel Trudeau realized he was going to die Nov. 14 , 1998 , when a wall of wet snow sent him tumbling down a southern B. C. mountainside into ice cold Kokanee Lake .\nA springtime view of Kokanee Lake , where Michel still rests The youngest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau spent several minutes in the water , fighting to remove his heavy backpack and touring skis , all the while shouting for help and groaning , eyewitness Eric Lemieux told reporters later .\nWe could see him , said Lemieux , one of several skiers following Trudeau when the avalanche struck .\nWe knew it was going to be a slow and painful death .\nBut we couldn t reach him .\nHe was in the middle of the lake .\nTrudeau , 23 , eventually sank out of sight - leaving behind one of Canada s most famous families to grieve without a casket .\nScuba divers have failed to find Trudeau s body in the glacier-fed lake in Kootenay Glacier Provincial Park , about 300 kilometres southwest of Calgary .\nThe Trudeaus did not push search and rescue teams to locate Michel s body .\nSays Justin Trudeau , Michel s older brother , of his final resting place in Kokanee Lake ; It s glorious .\nIt s one of the most beautiful places I ve ever seen .\nThat s where he was destined to be .\nTrudeau had lived in the area for a year , working as a ski lift attendant at Red Mountain , near Rossland .\nHe was a fun-loving young man , who enjoyed the outdoors , and had traveled out West after graduating from university .\nSince Michel s death , the Trudeau family has been working closely with the Canadian Avalanche Association to promote avalanche safety .\nYoung Michel with his famous father .\nMichel with his best buddy Makwa , the summer before his death .\nIn The Wrong Place at The Wrong Time A New Hampshire man was killed on November 10 , 1998 after he triggered an avalanche on the upper mountain of a closed ski area in Utah .\nJeff Clement , 21 , was snowboarding with four friends in Little Cottonwood Canyon , between the Alta and Snowbird ski areas , when the incident occurred .\nIt was reported that he was the last to start down and he s the one who broke it loose , Captain Gil Howard , of the Salt Lake Country Sheriff s Office , said .\nIt was a way unstable area .\nThe problem was they were in a ski area , but they were faced with backcountry conditions ... Sgt.\nGil Howard , Salt Lake County Sheriff s Office All five were buried to one extent or another , Howard said , and he was the only one completely buried .\nThe other four were able to extract themselves , but Clement was buried with his board uphill .\nCarrying no beacons or shovels , the friends reportedly did everything they could to locate Clement but were unsuccessful .\nClement s body was found by an Alta rescue dog , but a heavy storm predicted for the area Saturday night forced rescuers to abandon the recovery effort .\nReturning the next day during snows , rescuers shocked the mountain to release unstable snow and safely removed the body .\nClement was originally buried under three feet of snow .\nThough not officially determined , Howard said it appeared Clement may have died from severe head trauma .\nThe problem was they were in a ski area , but they were faced with backcountry conditions .\nThey are lulled into a false sense , but there s no control work done and this is the tragic outcome , Howard said .\nHoward said he has heard there were upwards of 50 people in the area that day .\nClement and his friends were just in the wrong area on the wrong day and at the wrong time , he said .\nHoward said the five friends had hiked the ridgeline from Alta ski area onto Mt.\nBaldy .\nNot yet open for the season , the upper mountain , Howard said , is a popular pre-season destination for adventurous skiers and snowboarders .\nBut , without any controls yet done on the mountain , avalanche danger was extremely high and the fact that the area was closed is well posted .\nThey had to hike quite a bit to get up there , Howard said , but it s not atypical .\nIt s a hard way to learn , but if we can prevent it from happening again , then there s a small amount of good that comes from it .\nHoward said it is imperative people learn about snow conditions and snow safety , as well as carry emergency equipment .\nContributing Factors Weather This is the most important factor in determining whether avalanches are likely and the evolution of the snowpack is entirely dependent on this .\nMany weather variables affect avalanche release and information can often be gained before setting out .\nA sudden temperature rise may indicate a hazard , as the nearer the snow gets to zero degrees celsius , the more dangerous it is .\nRemember 90 \% of all avalanches occur during a snowstorm .\nSnowpacks When visibility is adequate , snowpack observation can begin from the roadside .\nEvidence of recent avalanche activity , main snow accumulation zones , fresh loading by new snow and drifting , can often be noted from below .\nObservations can continue on the approach , noting such details as depth of foot penetration , cornice build-up , ease of release of small slabs and the effect which localized wind patterns may have had on slab formation .\nAny suspect slopes which must be negotiated bearing in mind that the safest course is to avoid them may be tested by digging a snowpit .\nPits should not initially be dug on the main suspect slope , but on small , safe slopes of similar orientation .\nThe following features should be looked for Adjacent layers of different hardness difference of more than 2 on scale of 5 Very soft layers fist penetrates easily Water drops squeezed out of a snowball made from any layer Layers of ice Layers of graupel rounded , heavily rimed pellets - these act like a layer of ball-bearings in the snowpack Feathery or faceted crystals Layers of loose , uncohesive grains Air space Any of the above may be the source of a dangerous weakness in the snowpack .\nTravel in Hazard Areas If it is essential to proceed , the following should be borne in mind Solo travellers in avalanche terrain run particularly grave hazards Skiers are in greater danger than walkers - the lateral cutting action of skis readily releases unstable snow .\nAll off-piste skiers should use avalanche transceivers and have them SWITCHED ON before leaving base .\nThey should carry collapsible probes and shovels .\nClimbers and walkers should consider the use of these items .\nDirect descent or ascent is safer than traversing .\nGo one at a time - the others should closely observe the progress of the person on the suspect slope .\nClose up clothing , wrap scarf or other item round mouth and nose .\n90 \% OF AVALANCHES INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS ARE TRIGGERED BY THEIR VICTIMS .\nSafe Travel Practices Follow terrain features that are least likely to avalanche .\nUse ridges and areas where the snow has been blown off to ascend or descend .\nAvoid traversing under avalanche slopes .\nIf natural avalanches are likely high or extreme hazard or any time there are whomping sounds in the snowpack .\nTraverse slopes as high as possible .\nWhenever crossing a potential avalanche slope , cross as high as possible so as to have as little snow to bury you as possible .\nWatch out for a falling hazard .\nWhen traversing slopes travel one at a time .\nTwo reasons for this , one is to avoid having more than one person caught in an avalanche the other is to minimize the load on the slope .\nAvoid climbing under another person .\nAvalanches can be triggered by the other party often with little consequence to them and burying you .\nTravel one at a time from safe zone to safe zone when ascending or descending gullies .\nLook for alcoves or walls that will protect you should your partner kick off a small avalanche .\nUse belaying techniques when climbing gullies that have avalanche hazard .\nWe are often told not to rope up in avalanche terrain , but when rock or ice protection is available that will not slide with the slope , the rope can keep you from being carried away by the avalanche .\nThis can protect you from small localized avalanches .\nWatch for terrain traps .\nMake sure that should you be involved in an avalanche , the debris will not be trapped and cause a small slide to have a deep debris pile .\nWatch for the falling hazard even when crossing the most benign looking slopes .\nEven the smallest of avalanches can be deadly when mixed with a cliff band .\nThis can be important between ice bulges or on ridges .\nAlways wear an avalanche transceiver and carry a shovel and probe .\nA search dog locates a buried victim .\nOnce a victim is completely buried there is only a 1 in 3 chance of survival .\nWinter Hazards -

Woman Climber A Report by Eliza Moran , AAC Director The following May 22 , 1998 report originally appearing in the American Alpine Club , Sierra Nevada Section Newsletter July \\/ August 1998 is reprinted with the permission of Eliza Moran and the American Alpine Club .\nThe British Mountaineering Council sponsored a first in the world , a symposium dedicated to and for woman climbers .\nThe idea was to bring together women climbers of all abilities , to explore issues facing them and to enjoy climbing in one of the UK s premier venues , North Wales .\nTwenty-six countries responded by sending 80 women ranging in age from 15 to 68 years .\nEvery aspect of this sport was represented in the diversity of women sent -- mountaineers , ice climbers , traditional rock climbers , boulderers , sport climbers , professionals and amateurs .\nWhat came out of this meeting ?\nAs the group first came together , it was quite apparent that we judged each other by nationalities .\nInteraction began in English , no matter the country of origin .\nThe official welcomes and written agenda presented by our hosts did not really hint at what would transpire during the week .\nI don t think that most of the invited guests really knew just what we were going to do either , but like all grand adventures , it begins with the first step .\nOver meals , out climbing , in lectures , and while shopping for climbing equipment that was generously offered at discount rates by local manufacturers and stores , we came to discover who we were .\nNational labels fell by the wayside as we found no stereotypes in looks or styles .\nNo elitism or competition manifested itself as a form of segregation during our climbing days .\nEducational levels ranked highly , with a strong representation in the sciences and medicine .\nClimbing -- was it a hobby , a sport , a job , a form of competition , or a way of life ?\nThis theme soon emerged as new personalities came to the front daily , expressing viewpoints that were encouraged by our British women climber hosts .\nWhy do we stay in climbing ?\nHere the answers became as varied and intriguing as one might expect .\nWho encouraged you ?\nWho supports you ?\nWhy were you sent to represent your Federation at this symposium ?\nWas it a man who selected you ?\nWhat do you think that you will take back with you to your Federation from this symposium ?\nAgain , another theme became apparent as we all saw the similarities of our predicaments as woman athletes trying to validate our desire to climb .\nOne of the BMC s guest speakers on media night lecture in addition to our AAC President , Alison Osius was author and pathologist Dr. Rosemary Cohen .\nShe presented a small chronology of books and articles written about women climbers .\nOf note was an article written in 1838 , entitled Thwarted Maiden Lady .\nThis defined the woman climber as a spinster who could not find or get a man to marry her .\nUniversal laughter filled the room as this was translated not an easy task to translate thwarted into 26 languages .\nHowever , in this laughter was a recognition amongst us of the the shadow question that still exists today for all women .\nYou must be climbing because your real life as a woman is not complete , i.e. , no man to marry .\nSomething must be missing that is causing you to do this , otherwise a happy woman would not be climbing .\nWhy do you want to take that risk and if you do now that you are having children , you wouldn t do that anymore would you ?\nEvery woman in the room had faced some format of this question sometime in her life .\nWhen we heard of the lonely efforts of the woman climbers in Iran , India , Nepal , and Pakistan , we knew that we were not so far removed from this ourselves .\nFrancoise Aubert , UIAGM French Guide that makes her living guiding , revealed to us that her new ice route topping out on Point Helen was not recognized by her French Climbing Federation .\nAs of yet , this ice climb has not been repeated .\nIn solidarity we realized we are not so far removed from the stigma of the Thwarted Maiden Lady .\nMany wonderful exchanges continued that were as novel as the speakers .\nBackgrounds as exotic as the countries represented and adventures came to the front as we discovered who we were oceanographers , physicists , physicians , teachers , biologists , flight attendants , North Sea oil riggers , physical therapists , students , grandmothers , tour operators , public relations directors .\nWe were problem solvers .\nWe too came to ask ourselves the question , Why do you climb ?\nAs to the diversity of answers supplied , I will leave that to you the reader to surmise .\nI came away from this meeting fatigued .\nI did not want to miss out on anything .\nThis meeting enabled me as an AAC Director to ask for a statement of support for our club s position with the Friends of Valley in our lawsuit against the National Park Service .\nAfter a day of intense discussion with all delegates , I was proud to see this group give the AAC a unanimous vote of support .\nYou can see this statement on The Friends of Yosemite Valley web site .\nWhat is the image of the woman climber ?\nShe is anything and everything , she is always the same and she is never the same .\nShe can make a difference and will if given the chance .\nWhatever you may think , I believe it is safe to say we don t see ourselves as Thwarted Fair Maidens .\nWe see ourselves as elusive in identification as the adventures we seek .\nHow else could names such as The Wall of the Early Morning Light or Dreams of White Horses come to be without this imagination and desire for the unknown .\nBut then again , that is what being a woman is all about , an elusive evolving image that we choose to explore as we get to know ourselves .\nPerhaps that is what life can be , perhaps that is why mountaineering is a way of life for those who are bold and dare .\nThe women climbers that attended this symposium reaffirmed this choice .\nComments are welcome .\nPlease contact Eliza with your suggestions and ideas .\nEliza Moran , AAC Director ,

'home page | contact us !\n| search | site map | prayer request | Death in the Snow An Avalanche Tragedy Transcript - April 03 , 2003 Back to Main Page It s been the worst season for avalanche deaths in over 20 years .\nBut those numbers do little to console a community that was hit especially hard .\nThe students of Calgary s Strathcona Tweedsmuir were on a school trip in the mountains of B. C. It was a character building adventure trip - one that ended in a horrific tragedy .\nSeven of those children never returned from that trip and today we talk to one of the victim s families .\nA remarkable girl who led a remarkable life .\nMeet Marissa Staddon These are of Marissa in her early days .\nI think Karl took this one when she was just a couple days old .\nAnd that s her one-year-old photo .\nThis is a picture of Marissa taken at the beginning of school for grade 10 .\nShe looks you straight in the eye from whatever angle you re looking at this photograph .\nMarissa started skating at three years of age .\nShe loved it .\nShe had great capacity and natural ability for it .\nAnd a year ago was sort of the highlight of her skating time in that she did manage to go to Canadian junior national competition .\nShe glowed when she was on the ice This is Marissa with her younger sister , Brittany , who she loved and adored .\nWe had a lot of great times as family together .\nThis is in the mountains .\nWe started when they were very young taking trips to the mountains .\nfew more family vacation photos We went up Heart Mountain which is just east of Canmore , by Lacktah s Arch .\nMarissa was ten years of age at that time .\nI think it s 2,500 feet of net vertical .\nHere she is at the top .\nMemories of the mountains , and a mountain that forever changed this family .\nHeadlines \\/ \\/ the helicopter \\/ \\/ the mountains in black and white Now the memories of mountains are very different .\nThis was Marissa s backpack that she took on the outdoor education trip where she was struck by the avalanche .\nIt was purchased new , this year , and fitted to her .\nShe was still wearing it when she was buried .\nShe was buried about two and a half metres below the surface wearing the backpack .\nTough going through it .\nI will show you some of the articles that she had in that backpack on the day she was struck .\nKarl and Donna Staddon have found themselves unpacking a storm of grief since their daughter Marissa s school , Stratchona Tweedsmuir , had it s outdoor education trip turned to tragedy .\nAt the time when we hear the news that Marissa was deceased , Brittany s response at that time was oh , I ve lost my very best friend and she said Marissa has taught me so much and I was looking forward to having her teach me more and more , I m gonna miss her so .\nAnd then she paused and a few minutes later Brittany spoke up and she said , well , wouldn t you know , Marissa was always such a competitor , and always looking to go for the gold , and here she s won this race , she s beat us all to heaven .\nSeven students , all 15 years old , died in the avalanche and sent their home city , Calgary , reeling .\nIt hits not just parents , it hits siblings .\nI mean this covers every relationship group , siblings , friends , parents , grandparents , everybody felt a sense of loss .\nLicia Corbella is an editor at the Calgary Sun .\nYou know that I don t want to use a clich , but it was an avalanche of grief .\nFirst there was the shuttle astronauts that perished .\nAnd then later that day there was another group of 7 bright lights just disappeared .\nAnd being that they were young people , and such connected young people , so involved in so many things , it didn t seem that there was any person in this city who didn t know someone who knew someone who knew them .\nOr who knew them personally .\nEverybody just got that sick sense in their feeling of so much potential lost .\nThere was a deep sense of sombreness in the city .\nIt really made the whole city seem smaller in an odd sense .\nLike a village .\nBecause everybody was connected in some way .\nIt was very well anytime young people die , but to have 7 at the same time all 15 years old , all grade 10 students , all of them remarkable young people with so much promise , it was just shocking .\nIt s been Canada s worst season for avalanche deaths .\nA mild winter created the most unstable snow pack Revelstoke had seen in thirty years .\nA reality that claimed 14 lives in 14 days .\nThis is an avalanche transceiver .\nAll of the students and the adults on the trip would have been wearing one of these .\nYou put these around your waist and over your shoulder to keep them secure .\nWhen the this is kind of like a key when its engaged in this , you can see , it starts to blink .\nThe number of blinks gives you a indication of the battery life .\nAnd you travel with it in transmit mode .\nAnd it sends out about every second a small radio frequency .\nAnd in the event of an avalanche everyone who is above ground or above snow , then switches their transceiver from transmit to receive .\nAnd you then go about trying to locate with this the people that are buried .\ngo down to confirm exactly where they re at .\nBecause you don t want to dig a deep hole to find out that you dug three feet off of where they re located .\nSo this is how they are used .\nAnd how some of the students were detected and saved as a result , by the transceiver .\nThat day in Revelstoke it wasn t human activity that began the avalanche , it was wind .\nOver a kilometre long crack in the snow loosening itself from the mountain .\nExperienced in wilderness trips , the Staddons have gone over all the details of this tragedy We viewed Marissa s body at the funeral home and she looked very much at peace , and at rest it gave us a certain measure of comfort that the avalanche itself hadn t caused he a lot of pain , from what we understand and having flown over the site later that day , she wasn t swept through trees , she wasn t swept over cliffs , but she was swept a long distance 4-500 metres we re told from the point she was standing at or skiing at the time she was struck by the avalanche , our firm belief is that while she was probably very frightened undoubtedly , that she didn t suffer a lot of pain , in the aftermath of the avalanche .\nSo we drove up to Roger s pass and Donna , Brittany and myself together with Jordy Sheppard who was the Parks Canada incident scene commander and the helicopter pilot we flew over the scene for 20 or 25 minutes .\nWhile we were over the scene and it will help us you know go back and locate the site pretty precisely where Marissa came to rest after the avalanche .\nCould you see it from the air ?\nAbsolutely , it was a huge hole , I mean most of the holes were huge .\nMarissa was buried we re told 2 metres down and so they dug out a big pit to reach out her body My understanding is that uh at the time of the avalanche the trip leader was buried save except for his hand which was above the snow , we spoke with him the morning after the avalanche , he said that he could feel himself blacking out so time was getting away from him as well and Rich and Abby being first on scene saw the hand and were able to scoop down to his face and restore his breathing ... 7 helicopters were brought to bear over the scene in very short order there were 35 professionals on the ground involved in the location digging and in attempted revival efforts and the kids dug as well ... the kids dug as well because there was a time lag between the time that the satellite phone call went out and the time Parks Canada arrived .\nFurther up the mountain where the avalanche started and you can see how much snow really fed into this avalanche my estimate and I ve also read that Parks Canada I believe have said they estimate in the thousands of tons of snow that came down Parks Canada personnel have also commented uh think in terms of speeds of 160-200 km an hour .\nI believe I m told and I can t recall whether it was 37 or 47 shovels were broken by the rescuers in trying to dig and extricate those that were buried by the avalanche so again it speaks volumes to the effort , the Herculean effort of the rescuers to try to dig these kids out and revive them Marissa always had a disposable camera in her back pack so she could take pictures of her adventures , and when we got her back pack back , her camera was there and so we took it in and had the film developed , and there s a photo here that would ve been taken the day before , so on the Friday afternoon when they were out skiing and it s Marissa with the two other girls that were part of the group , friends of hers and , and it just captures them with great smiles , and just enjoying their adventure So are you at peace that the school had done everything it could that this was not beyond acceptable ?\nYes I am , and the reason is that I have climbed for over 20 yrs , I ve taken advanced avalanche training I ve climbed in these sorts of conditions , I had the privilege of traveling with this group of students together with the trip leader in the fall of 2002 and nothing came to light in all of our discussion on sun Feb 2nd with all of the personnel or subsequent to that date that has made me think that there was an error in human decision making .\nI really think it s remarkable that the first person dug out had the satellite phone .\nIt s also incredibly remarkable that Rich and Abby , husband and wife , Rich Marshall and Abby Watkins uh were just ahead , had passed the school group , and had just missed it , were able to come back and be the first persons on scene after the avalanche and if not for their efforts the consequences would ve been considerably worse then they are Karl , as I m looking at the gear that she all had , and I m thinking about this trip as it was about building character , helping students learn how to conquer challenges explain to us what you think goes on in the psyche of a person as they learn to conquer nature ?\nI can speak from my own experience and I think most of the students if not all of the students were having similar experiences themselves .\nIt s great for building confidence , it teaches you to prioritize , weight is always an issue , the backpacks teaches you to be aware of the environment that you re operating in .\nThese are transferrable life skills that you learn in the mountains .\nAbsolutely , you develop a mind set of how you want to deal with risk and there s also for me and for most of these students that there s a sense of joyousness of being in the mountains , you simply see things in the mountains that you do not see in the cities .\nThis is the sleeping bag that Marissa took , it s one that I ve had for many years , but is more than adequate for the purposes of this trip .\n... . when we return ... Unpacking what Marissa held in her heart .\nPart 2 All the Calgary teenagers lost in the avalanche were seen as incredible young Canadians , and Marissa Staddon lived life large .\nAnd her friends were such a big part of her life .\nThey were a very close knit group .\nThey had fun together .\nStudied together .\nAnd they grew in Christ together .\nThey are a group of friends who keep each other accountable .\nThat was just so comforting as parents to know that the friends your daughter had were supporting and building , helping her to build her relationship with Christ .\nMarissa was an avid athlete , not only in figure skating , but also with school sports , team sports .\nMainly volleyball , badminton , and track and field .\nShe loved track and field and did very well in relay and long distance .\nAnd this particular photo was taken in June of 2002 , her grade 9 year .\nHer friend gave us this photo .\nAnd on it he wrote , on track for the Lord .\nAnd I just thought that was so wonderful .\nBecause that was indeed Marissa .\nMarissa played piano .\nStarted taking lessons when she was 7 years old .\nShe was currently working on her grade 10 her grade 10 level of piano .\nShe also played flute and clarinet and saxophone and also hand bells .\nShe used her music for relaxation .\nAnd then she would go of to skating in the evening she went to the arena for two hours of skating each evening I love this photo Marissa went on last year with her graduation grade 9 class from Glenmore Christian Academy in July to Mexico with Youth With A Mission .\nThey built a home for a needy family down there .\nThis picture was taken of Marissa on conjunction with her graduation of junior high in June of 2002 .\nIts actually the dress she had on for the funeral as well .\nHow did you decide that ?\nActually I talked with Brittany , Marissa s sister , and I said what dress do you think .\nAnd she said , oh mom , her graduation dress .\nShe loved that .\nI can remember her putting it on and swirling around and going , ah this feels good .\nBecause both Brittany and I remember so well her joy with that we just decided that that would be the dress we would have for her funeral .\nFor her ultimate graduation .\nFor her ultimate graduation .\nPerfect .\nYes .\nWe just knew it had to be a celebration , and we also wanted to have the plan of salvation to be spoken that word to be given to all who were going to be there because Marissa lived her life solid in Christ and she was always happy to share with others about Christ , the difference that was in her life and so we wanted the message of salvation .\nCelebration Service clip - Pastor Matheson God so loved you Marissa .\nGod so loved you .\nThat he gave his only Son Jesus .\nThat Marissa that you might not perish .\nSo that you may have everlasting life .\nMarissa accepted Christ into her heart when she was 4 years old , it was one day when I had picked her up from pre-school , she attended a pre-school at a local church and when I picked her up and put her into the van , she said , Mom , I asked Jesus into my heart today .\nAnd I said Oh Marissa , I am sooo happy for you .\nMarissa did go on being keenly attuned to things of the Lord , reading her Bible , praying everyday , even through her teen years , her Bible was always at her bed side , and she read every night before she went to sleep .\nCelebration Service Clip Where would you be without Him on this one ?\nDespair .\nI think it would be despair , but when when we hold onto God , he understands our pain , he understands our loss , he understands our confusion we sometimes feel about all this too , but , uh there is not despair , what we have is hope , because um know that God will give us the strength to carry on , and that we have the hope and the promise that we will be with Marissa again in heaven because we have asked Christ into our heart , we have that commitment , we have that assurance that we will be in heaven with God one day and that means that we re gonna be in heaven with Marissa too .\nAnd that , just puts a whole different turn on the grieving that we are going through on this journey because of the hope , the wonderful hope that he s given us .\nAnd when you made your farewell card for Marissa , Karl you wrote it differently than most people , can you tell us why ?\nThe we uh look at some other precedent s , maybe four or five , and most of the other precedents , were people who had lived to be maybe 75 or 80 or 85 , Marissa only lived to15 , and I thought that was such a pathetically short amount small number and so I calculated the number of days including leap years ; it was 5712 days , that sounds like a lot , a lot better number So what we wrote in our card was born June 13th 1987 , Heaven bound Feb1st 2003 Precious days 5712 and they truly were very very special days , we think around Marissa , and donna and I were talking , and you know I guess there s a couple things , one is two scenarios , one is we never had Marissa and the other is we had Marissa for that number of days , which would you rather have ?\nNo choice , absolutely would take those 5712 days with Marissa the second question , was Marissa ours , or was Marissa God s gift to us for whatever reason , and trusted to us to raise her up and it s the later , she was God s gift .\nTribute clip from Celebration Service from a friend .\nYouth pastor Eryn Moore There s no guarantees in life in terms of how long we ll actually live .\nAnd I think that really caught a lot of our students off guard .\nA lot them really struggled with it at first .\nThere was some anger , there was some questioning about why God would allow something like this to happen .\nSometimes I think the best answer is no answer .\nI ve seen God work through this tragedy in amazing ways , but I couldn t say to these students , God allowed Marissa to die so that these could happen .\nI don t know if that was totally His will .\nI don t know .\nI know that our lives are short .\nThat God never promises us any time of life on earth .\nLife is a gift .\nThis is an assignment for language arts when she was in grade eight .\nIt s a poetry project and they can choose any theme of their own that they would like , and they have to write poems .\nMarissa chose the theme of God .\nWhen her sister , when Brittany got this out of her closet and we read it through we realized how how wonderful this was for us to have now .\nTo have these poems Marissa wrote from her heart .\nAnd they reflected her closeness with God .\nHer walk , her journey with God .\nYou have a favorite in here , tell us why .\nYes I do have a favorite .\nThe favorite that I have is this free verse which is called A Fresh Start .\nWould it be all right if I read it .\nSadly , standing in shimmering , sprinkling snow .\nShoulders down .\nFace downward .\nEmotionally down cast .\nShe ponders , wonders , cries .\nTears walking round her face .\nCovering all in their course , overcoming the sink before them .\nWhy is she alone ?\nWhy out in the snow ?\nOut in the cold ?\nKneeling .\nBowing .\nStumbling .\nFallen in the frost .\nHands grasp .\nEyes closed .\nHeart welcoming .\nShe finds a Redeemer .\nA Saviour .\nA fresh start .\nI reflect more on it through the lens of the avalanche .\nI don t know that its prophecy but the parallels here are incredible .\nAbsolutely incredible .\nIt touches me every time we look at it .\nYou had a very unique way of letting Marissa say goodbye to her friends , it was on a CD that she recorded , tell us about that .\nWell in December of 2000 Marissa decided she wanted to put a compilation of music together of contemporary Christian music and I encouraged her that I think it would be good to have a lead in voice section .\nIt was appropriate for the CD in Dec. 2000 and it was entirely appropriate for her funeral service , her celebration service ... ... ending with Marissa Jeremiah 29 11 top of page All images , text , and design copyrighted by Listen Up TV 2003\nListen Up Program - Death in the Snow An Avalanche Tragedy Transcript - Part I - Apr 03\\/03\n',092

And while the media backlash against Hargreaves didn t diminish the number of women who climb , neither did it have a long-term effect on the latent sexism in the general mountaineering community .\nSays cutting-edge alpinist Kitty Calhoun , a mother who has attempted the Karakoram s Latok I and III , I think a double standard still exists .\nIt still seems more acceptable for a dad to be a climber .\nNew Directions The death of Hargreaves also came at the time of a significant shift in focus for female alpinists visting the Karakoram .\nSuccessful expeditions to the region no longer focussed on large , siege-style ascents .\nInstead , small groups with five or fewer members climbed quickly and with less equipment .\nBoskoff , who summitted Broad Peak in 1995 and Gasherbrum II in 1999 , chooses this style of climbing .\nI prefer to acclimatize on another mountain and then climb an 8000er in one push , Boskoff explains .\nIt s simple , safer , and I enjoy it .\nI m not climbing the same route again and again to acclimatize .\nIn the summer of 2002 she attempted an alpine-style ascent of K2 with Charlie Fowler , but failed due to high winds and uncertain weather .\nCalhoun prefers to climb in a party of just two , but sometimes goes with two parties of two .\nWith this minimalist approach , she has attempted the North Ridge of 23,400-foot Latok I in 1993 and the West Face of 22,800-foot Latok III in 1998 .\nAlong with Julie Brugger , Andy De Klerk , and Colin Grissom , she made it approximately one-third of the way up Latok I before the weather turned sour .\nOn Latok III Calhoun , her now - husband Jay Smith , Steve Quinlan , and Ken Sauls attempted a highly technical new big-wall route .\nThey were forced to abandon their attempt at over 19,000 feet after running out of food .\nAbby Watkins , another top female ice , rock , and big-wall climber , and an Association of Canadian Mountain Guides certified guide , says she hasn t experienced much sexism within the climbing community , nor does she see much difference between the abilities of women and men .\nLike many Gen - X women , Watkins , an Australian expatriate living in Canada , says her parents never really put gender limits on me .\nThey encouraged me at whatever I was good at or what I desired to do .\nShe also says that she has organized trips with women not because they were women , but because they were my climbing partners .\nIn 1998 , Watkins , along with New Zealander Nicola Woolford and Australian Vera Wong , established Excess Baggage VI 5.10 A2 + on 19,000-foot Changi Tower in the Nangma Valley of the Karakoram s Hushe region .\nThe route took seven days and ran the gamut from mixed to free to big-wall aid .\nAccomplished British rock climber Kath Pyke agrees with Watkins , and said she has gone on expeditions with women simply because she has many women partners .\nI just know these people on a different level because I ve spent more time with them , says Pyke , who along with fellow Brits Glenda Huxter and Louise Thomas climbed 19,000-foot Beatrice Tower , on the north side of the Charakusa Valley also in the Hushe region in 1997 .\nThe threesome spent nine days linking cracks and corners with difficult traverses and blank faces .\nThe route , a solidly graded 5.11 A3 + , is one of only a few big walls in the Karakoram to be completed by an entirely female team , along with Excess Baggage .\nPrevious Page 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page During this special online offer , you can get a TRIAL ISSUE of Climbing and receive an additional 8 issues for only $ 17.95 - that s a savings of 60 \% off the cover price !\nIf you choose not to subscribe , just write cancel on your invoice , send it back and owe nothing .\nEither way , the trial issue is yours to keep with our thanks .\nOutside the US ?\nCanada or International GIVE A GIFT Email First Name Last Name Address Line 1 Address Line 2 City State Zip Select a payment option Charge my credit card Bill me later Do you have a promotional coupon code ?\nEnter Code Subscribe | Give a Gift | Subscriber Services | Contact | Advertise | Privacy Statement Copyright 2004 PRIMEDIA , Inc. .

'How a carefully planned adventure to the B. C. backcountry became a tragedy that swept seven teens to their deaths .\nIt s a soft , gray morning .\nThe ground is blanketed by eight centimeters of fresh snow .\nThe temperature hovers around zero .\nThe past 24 hours have been avalanche-free , and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia .\nThey are not alone .\nThe mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass .\nHusband and wife pause to say hello .\nIt s a beautiful day out here , isn t it ?\nsays Abby .\nYes , someone responds .\nThey leave the 14 teenagers and three adults behind , climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area .\nAbby looks back at the people below and a gangly teen , all arms and legs , catches her eye .\nAren t kids funny ?\nLook at that kid , she tells Rich .\nAt that very moment , just before noon on Saturday , something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain .\nAbby and Rich hear a thunderous roar .\nThey watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley , picking up speed and debris .\nThe school group is directly in its path .\nRich screams Avalanche !\nAvalanche !\nAvalanche !\nThe skiers look up .\nBen Albert is frantically trying to cram his day pack into a big black backpack already bulging with clothes , equipment and enough food for a breakfast and stir-fry dinner for himself and three other hungry 15-year-olds .\nHe finally wedges it in and staggers out the door .\nIt s early Friday morning .\nHis mother , Carol Neale , watches uneasily as he and her husband Gerald pull out onto the road and head to the Canadian Tire parking lot on the western edge of Calgary .\nThere , Ben will rendezvous with 13 other Grade 10 students from the elite Strathcona - Tweedsmuir private school for a long weekend of backcountry , telemark skiing , a difficult activity that combines cross-country and downhill .\nThe trip is the culmination of two months of intense training and the most arduous yet of the school s celebrated , year-long outdoor education program .\nDespite the early hour , the excitement among the 11 boys and three girls is infectious .\nMichael Shaw is so keyed up he talked the night away with his younger sister Kathryn .\nShe tried to get him to go to bed but he just kept talking .\nThey are close , these healthy , strong , accomplished 15-year-olds .\nMany have grown up together .\nMichael and his best pal Taylor Carcasole are there , in one of two vans that will take everyone to Rogers Pass .\nThe two are inseparable .\nTeachers know them as mischief .\nTaylor is the mis , and Michael the chief .\nBen Albert sees Scott Broshko and Jeff Trickett .\nThey are three parts of a group of four talented teens known as the Fearsome Foursome .\nScott has been talking about the expedition almost nonstop since training began .\nOutdoor trips are his passion .\nFor his birthday , he asked for a sleeping bag .\nThe night before , Daniel Arato bombarded his older brother Thomas with excited questions about what to take .\nHis father had left a day earlier for his own ski trip .\nThe two exchanged kisses and hugs .\nMr. Arato told his son to keep his head in the game and do what he s told .\nAs the two parted , Daniel told his dad I love you .\nThe leader of the expedition is teacher Andrew Nicholson , a skilled and experienced skier , well-trained in avalanche awareness .\nHe is so demanding in checking snow conditions that previous groups have dubbed him Nazi Nick .\nParents have signed waivers protecting the school in the event of deaths or injuries , but Carol Neale is worried .\nShe can t stop thinking about an avalanche less than two weeks before that killed seven experienced backcountry skiers just 40 kilometers away from where Ben and his classmates are headed .\nScott Broshko s mother , Donna , knows about that avalanche , too .\nBut she thinks What is the likelihood ?\nJust what is the likelihood of that ?\nShe gives him a quick hug .\nHe ll be back on Monday .\nIt s a four-hour journey to Glacier National Park .\nThe winding , 350-kilometre drive along the Trans - Canada Highway west from Calgary offers some of the most stunning views in the country , replete with neck-craning mountain walls and stomach-churning sheer drops to valleys below .\nAlong the way are warning signs for fallen rocks and avalanche debris .\nRunaway lanes for truckers who lose their brakes on the steep inclines are common .\nEven more ominous are five long avalanche tunnels protecting the highway from the walls of snow that regularly cut loose from the steep upper slopes surrounding Rogers Pass .\nWith an annual average snowfall of up to 21 meters , the area has one of the deadliest concentrations of avalanches in the world -- enough to keep an on-site military unit stationed there , equipped with explosives and howitzers to bring down threatening avalanches before they become dangerous .\nThe vans arrive at the park about noon , and the STS expedition wastes no time heading for its weekend headquarters , the A. O. Wheeler Hut , an easy two-kilometer trek from the highway .\nThe A-frame log building , complete with two wood stoves and propane systems for cooking and light , is nestled in a cedar forest .\nThe cabin sleeps 24 in three rooms .\nThe teenagers stow their large packs and , after exacting tests of snow conditions by Mr. Nicholson , they start to ski , exhilarated by liberation from school on a Friday afternoon and giddy with the fresh mountain air .\nThat evening , exhausted from their wonderful afternoon , the students are divided into groups .\nEach prepares its own dinner .\nMarissa Staddon and her group pig out on chocolate fondue .\nScott Broshko s dines on quesadillas , much to the envy of another group grumpily making do with Hamburger Helper .\nThrough the night , snoring from Scott and his pal Jeff Trickett keeps some of the 11 boys in the same room from sleeping .\nBy the time they wake Saturday morning , Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers .\nIn tree-line and alpine areas , the avalanche risk has been assessed as considerable , the mid-range of the five possible ratings .\nBelow the tree line , the risk is assessed as moderate , with natural avalanches unlikely .\nAnd the STS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemark expedition to Balu Pass .\nBut the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize .\nThere were similar references for the same mountain range in avalanche bulletins last month , just before the deadly slide that claimed seven lives near Revelstoke , B. C. The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building , a macaroni-shaped structure with a sod and timber roof , to pore over the latest information .\nMr. Nicholson goes inside .\nHe asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher and a chaperone .\nThe group decides it is safe to ski that day .\nBy 10 15 a.m. , they are on the trailhead to the pass , five kilometers away , described by backcountry enthusiasts as an easy , but beautiful trail .\nThey ski through forest , along a rocky creek , over a snow-covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley .\nSurrounded by mountains and deep powder snow , the scenery is breathtaking .\nReminders of past avalanches are everywhere .\nRelentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over the years have littered the area with rocks and stumps .\nFoliage is sparse on the valley floor .\nThe school group successfully crosses four avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley , and three on the south side .\nThey note that the debris from one avalanche path across the valley is no more than a week old .\nThey are halfway to their destination .\nThe guide s frantic warning comes too late .\nThe avalanche hits them head on .\nIn a matter of seconds , all 17 skiers are swept away in a huge , terrifying tangle of snow , rocks and trees .\nThe swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds , Abby thinks .\nA huge roar .\nThe power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way .\n.\n.\n.\nNobody could have got out of the way .\nNobody .\nAvalanche Spread The river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers , then separates them .\nA section of the slide breaks away and keeps going , carrying a number of victims hundreds of meters down the valley .\nDisoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to swim to the surface , this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 meters beneath the concrete-hard snow .\nUp in the trees , Abby and Rich are dusted by a thick cloud of powder .\nA terrible silence falls over the valley .\nThough their hearts are thumping , they shut down their emotions .\nOn goes the search-and-rescue switch , one they have trained for years to put into practice .\nThey race down to the first group of buried skiers .\nThe only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow .\nThe others , in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley , are buried much deeper .\nAlone at the scene , the husband-and-wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions .\nWho to save first ?\nNot everybody would make it , they reason .\nBut those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival .\nRich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging .\nIt s Andrew Nicholson .\nHe finds Mr. Nicholson s shovel so the group leader can dig himself out , and moves on .\nMr. Nicholson has a satellite phone and calls for help .\nBut for the next 45 minutes , except for the victims , Rich and Abby are there by themselves , working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow .\nThe guides transceivers work perfectly , honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons , like shouts from the grave .\nThe couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork .\nOnly dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing .\nClear snow from the victim s face .\nNo CPR before moving on to the next victim .\nThere are too many .\nLet survivors dig themselves out .\nOnce free , the numb and distraught living do their best to help .\nTaylor Carcasole is frantic .\nHis best friend Michael Shaw is missing .\nWhere s Michael ?\nWhere s Michael ?\nThe victims are scattered beneath the snow .\nRich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible .\nThe first five people they pull out survive .\nThose survivors go on to rescue others .\nEveryone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead .\nThe grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over .\nSeven students make it .\nSeven do not .\nAn hour after the avalanche , seven helicopters , three dogs and more than 30 individuals are on site .\nBy 1 30 p.m. , the final victim has been dug out .\nOne survivor , with a broken ankle , is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital .\nThe remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden s station .\nThe bodies go , too .\nThey are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building .\nChuck Purse , Revelstoke s part-time coroner , is investigating his second seven-death avalanche within two weeks .\nHe examines each body in turn .\nNone show signs of major injury .\nThey were simply swept away and buried , dying from asphyxiation .\nThe bodies are wrapped in blankets , put in body bags and taken to the local Brandon Bowers Funeral Chapel .\nCo-owner Gary Sulz sends ordinary vans to collect the bodies because he thinks the sight of a fleet of hearses will upset the survivors .\nBack in Calgary , news of the tragedy begins rippling through the close-knit community of parents by late afternoon .\nDonna and Dave Broshko are just leaving for evening mass when Strathcona - Tweedsmuir head Tony Macoun calls to tell them there s been an accident .\nHe says there are fatalities .\nHe doesn t say who has died .\nMrs. Broshko immediately phones Ben Albert s mother , Carol Neale .\nBen and Scott have been classmates since elementary school .\nCarol , have you heard ?\nThere s been an accident .\nWhat are you talking about ?\nNo !\nshe screams .\nI told him I didn t want him to go .\n.\n.\nI didn t want him to go .\nAt the Arato home , Peter , skiing that weekend at Big White in Kelowna , B. C. , is talking to his wife when her cell-phone rings .\nA friend has heard news reports of a tragedy where their son Daniel was skiing .\nMr. Arato soon learns from the radio that seven are dead from a school near Okotoks , where his boy s school is .\nHe thinks the odds will not be in his favor .\nThe parents are told to go to the school .\nJudith Arato makes the 30-kilometre drive alone .\nShe calls Peter in hysterics .\nDaniel is dead .\nMr. Arato s friends charter a plane and send him home .\nCarol Neale s worst fears are confirmed the moment she arrives at Strathcona - Tweedsmuir .\nAs she steps inside the foyer , another mother stops her .\nI ve heard from my son , she tells Ms. Neale , relief written all over her face .\nI haven t heard from my son , replies Ms. Neale .\nMinutes later , Tony Macoun tells her why .\nBen is dead .\nMrs. Broshko , meanwhile , is panic-stricken , a horrible sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach .\nShe can t stand not knowing .\nShe phones the RCMP in Revelstoke .\nNo luck .\nShe phones Glacier Park Lodge , begging a clerk to go across the highway where the survivors are to see if her Scotty is alive .\nOh , please , please , please , go across the road for me .\nI will be forever in your debt .\nTell me that my son is there .\nThe woman agrees .\nShe phones back .\nNo one will tell her anything .\nFinally , the anguished couple head for the school .\nThey are ushered in to see Mr. Macoun .\nIt s such a tragedy , he begins .\nI don t want to hear about the tragedy .\nJust tell me about Scott , Mrs. Broshko says .\nMr. Macoun says I m very sorry .\nScott s gone .\nThat night , Donna Broshko sleeps with a picture of Scott and her taken just before he went to the school s formal Christmas dance .\nHe is wearing his dad s suit and tie .\nHis father wore the same suit and tie at Scott s funeral on Thursday .\nSkiers are soon back on the same Connaught Creek trail where last week s avalanche claimed its bright young victims .\nThey ask offhandedly about the morgue , worried that the jagged debris may be tricky to cross .\nNot far from the trailhead lies a wreath , with two ski poles stuck upright in the snow .\nNames of the dead 15-year-olds -- Jeff Trickett , Scott Broshko , Daniel Arato , Ben Albert , Marissa Staddon , Michael Shaw and Alex Pattillo -- are listed on the wreath , with the epigraph Your Youth Will Be Eternal .\nFarther along the path one glimpses a more somber memorial the deadly toe of the avalanche .\nAt the bottom of the valley are three pits .\nThey are several meters deep , a meter across , and not far apart .\nThree burial holes left behind , and no one has filled them in .\nTimetable of tragedy On Saturday , Feb. 1 , 14 Grade 10 students from Strathcona - Tweedsmuir School south of Calgary , set out on a backcountry ski trip up the Balu Pass in Glacier National Park , B. C. At around 11 45 a.m. , they were caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them .\nHere is the sequence of events on that day .\n1 .\nBefore departing , the leaders checked with the National Park staff for current avalanche conditions .\nThey were advised that the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line and considerable above it .\nStudents were equipped with personal avalanche beacons , probes and shovels .\nAt 8 40 a.m. , students left A. O. Wheeler Hut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Center , where they conducted at least one test for avalanche risk .\n2 .\n10 15 a.m. Commencement of trip up the Balu Pass trail .\nFollowing standard procedure , the one teacher led and the other adult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers , who were 15 metres from each other .\n3 .\n11 45 a.m. . About halfway up the valley , an avalanche slid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group .\nTwo skiers about 200 meters ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contacted wardens by satellite phone .\n12 30 p.m. Six students were reported alive .\n12 45 p.m. Wardens arrive .\n4 .\n1 30 p.m. All students were accounted for , including the seven who lost their lives .\n1.45 p.m. . One of the students was tobogganed back to the motel with a broken ankle .\nMeanwhile , helicopters joined the rescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot , from where they were transported to a private home in Revelstoke .\nHow the avalanche happened A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain , above the south side of Connaught Creek Valley .\nThis set off a huge second slide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that it rode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward down the valley , burying the group of skiers .\nCopyright 1995 - 2003 .\nAll contents of this Website are protected under federal copyright laws and may not be printed or reproduced without the written permission of National Scouting Report Inc. , Atlanta , GA , USA .\nNSR of Western Canada - The Ben Albert Memorial Award\n',112

'September 16 - 19 , 2004 Enter the Photo Gallery to see Photos from the Events Abby Watkins Nothing in the life of Abby Watkins has been typical .\nSince she began climbing in 1988 , Abby has proven her ability to excel at just about every kind of climbing imaginable .\nTake , for example , the fateful days in 1996 when she and fellow Austrailian Vera Wong set the Women s Speed Records on the Nose of El Cap 16 hrs .\n30 min .\nand the Regular Northwest Face on Half Dome 9 hrs .\n45 minutes .\nOr what about her mile-long list of competitive titles she s taken home over the years third place at the Ice Climbing World Championships in 2002 , first place at Festiglace du Quebec in 2001 , first place at the Ouray Ice Festival in the combined category , the U. S. Speed Climbing Championship in 1996 .\nYet among all her achievements , she remains fully grounded , The most important thing for me has not been the end results , the wins , the records .\nI am far more interested in the relationships I have created through climbing , and also the humility with which climbing has helped me approach the world .\nIn 1998 Abby took her skills to the mountains of Pakistan and promptly completed two first ascents in the Nangmah Valley .\nHer ability to set numerous speed-climbing records , onsight 5.12 b and lead M8 + mixed routes has proven that she s virtually unstoppable when it comes to climbing .\nPerhaps her background as a dancer , gymnast and track star has helped to fuel her fire .\nOr maybe it s the fact she grew up surfing and swimming in the oceans of Australia .\nOr maybe it s just her raw talent and flair for adventure that allows her to continually build upon her talents and add to her repertoire of successes .\nBut any way you look at it , you ll find Abby sharing her talent and experiences through her Ascending Women clinics and her job as a mountain guide .\n13-cm Turbo Express Ice Screws are Abby s favorite piece of Black Diamond equipment .\nShe loves not only their versatility , but the ease with which they place allowing her to conserve energy on steep terrain .\nHey , even people as un-typical as Abby can appreciate that !\nTop of Page is a beneficiary of the HERA Climb Last modified September 08 , 2004\nPhotos HERA Ovarian Cancer Climb for Life\n',003
'Print SATURDAY SPECIAL How a carefully planned adventure to the B. C. backcountry became a tragedy that swept seven teens to their deaths ROD MICKLEBURGH , JILL MAHONEY , PATRICK BRETHOUR AND DAWN WALTON - Saturday , February 8 , 2003 It s a soft , gray morning .\nThe ground is blanketed by eight centimetres of fresh snow .\nThe temperature hovers around zero .\nThe past 24 hours have been avalanche-free , and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia .\nThey are not alone .\nThe mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass .\nHusband and wife pause to say hello .\nIt s a beautiful day out here , isn t it ?\nsays Abby .\nYes , someone responds .\nThey leave the 14 teenagers and three adults behind , climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area .\nAbby looks back at the people below and a gangly teen , all arms and legs , catches her eye .\nAren t kids funny ?\nLook at that kid , she tells Rich .\nAt that very moment , just before noon on Saturday , something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain .\nAbby and Rich hear a thunderous roar .\nThey watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley , picking up speed and debris .\nThe school group is directly in its path .\nRich screams Avalanche !\nAvalanche !\nAvalanche !\nThe skiers look up .\nBen Albert is frantically trying to cram his day pack into a big black backpack already bulging with clothes , equipment and enough food for a breakfast and stir-fry dinner for himself and three other hungry 15-year-olds .\nHe finally wedges it in and staggers out the door .\nIt s early Friday morning .\nHis mother , Carol Neale , watches uneasily as he and her husband Gerald pull out onto the road and head to the Canadian Tire parking lot on the western edge of Calgary .\nThere , Ben will rendezvous with 13 other Grade 10 students from the elite Strathcona - Tweedsmuir private school for a long weekend of backcountry , telemark skiing , a difficult activity that combines cross-country and downhill .\nThe trip is the culmination of two months of intense training and the most arduous yet of the school s celebrated , year-long outdoor education program .\nDespite the early hour , the excitement among the 11 boys and three girls is infectious .\nMichael Shaw is so keyed up he talked the night away with his younger sister Kathryn .\nShe tried to get him to go to bed but he just kept talking .\nThey are close , these healthy , strong , accomplished 15-year-olds .\nMany have grown up together .\nMichael and his best pal Taylor Carcasole are there , in one of two vans that will take everyone to Rogers Pass .\nThe two are inseparable .\nTeachers know them as mischief .\nTaylor is the mis , and Michael the chief .\nBen Albert sees Scott Broshko and Jeff Trickett .\nThey are three parts of a group of four talented teens known as the Fearsome Foursome .\nScott has been talking about the expedition almost nonstop since training began .\nOutdoor trips are his passion .\nFor his birthday , he asked for a sleeping bag .\nThe night before , Daniel Arato bombarded his older brother Thomas with excited questions about what to take .\nHis father had left a day earlier for his own ski trip .\nThe two exchanged kisses and hugs .\nMr. Arato told his son to keep his head in the game and do what he s told .\nAs the two parted , Daniel told his dad I love you .\nThe leader of the expedition is teacher Andrew Nicholson , a skilled and experienced skier , well-trained in avalanche awareness .\nHe is so demanding in checking snow conditions that previous groups have dubbed him Nazi Nick .\nParents have signed waivers protecting the school in the event of deaths or injuries , but Carol Neale is worried .\nShe can t stop thinking about an avalanche less than two weeks before that killed seven experienced backcountry skiers just 40 kilometres away from where Ben and his classmates are headed .\nScott Broshko s mother , Donna , knows about that avalanche , too .\nBut she thinks What is the likelihood ?\nJust what is the likelihood of that ?\nShe gives him a quick hug .\nHe ll be back on Monday .\n\\*\\*\\* It s a four-hour journey to Glacier National Park .\nThe winding , 350-kilometre drive along the Trans - Canada Highway west from Calgary offers some of the most stunning views in the country , replete with neck-craning mountain walls and stomach-churning sheer drops to valleys below .\nAlong the way are warning signs for fallen rocks and avalanche debris .\nRunaway lanes for truckers who lose their brakes on the steep inclines are common .\nEven more ominous are five long avalanche tunnels protecting the highway from the walls of snow that regularly cut loose from the steep upper slopes surrounding Rogers Pass .\nWith an annual average snowfall of up to 21 metres , the area has one of the deadliest concentrations of avalanches in the world -- enough to keep an on-site military unit stationed there , equipped with explosives and howitzers to bring down threatening avalanches before they become dangerous .\nThe vans arrive at the park about noon , and the STS expedition wastes no time heading for its weekend headquarters , the A. O. Wheeler Hut , an easy two-kilometre trek from the highway .\nThe A-frame log building , complete with two wood stoves and propane systems for cooking and light , is nestled in a cedar forest .\nThe cabin sleeps 24 in three rooms .\nThe teenagers stow their large packs and , after exacting tests of snow conditions by Mr. Nicholson , they start to ski , exhilarated by liberation from school on a Friday afternoon and giddy with the fresh mountain air .\nThat evening , exhausted from their wonderful afternoon , the students are divided into groups .\nEach prepares its own dinner .\nMarissa Staddon and her group pig out on chocolate fondue .\nScott Broshko s dines on quesadillas , much to the envy of another group grumpily making do with Hamburger Helper .\nThrough the night , snoring from Scott and his pal Jeff Trickett keeps some of the 11 boys in the same room from sleeping .\nBy the time they wake Saturday morning , Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers .\nIn tree-line and alpine areas , the avalanche risk has been assessed as considerable , the mid-range of the five possible ratings .\nBelow the tree line , the risk is assessed as moderate , with natural avalanches unlikely .\nAnd the STS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemark expedition to Balu Pass .\nBut the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize .\nThere were similar references for the same mountain range in avalanche bulletins last month , just before the deadly slide that claimed seven lives near Revelstoke , B. C. The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building , a macaroni-shaped structure with a sod and timber roof , to pore over the latest information .\nMr. Nicholson goes inside .\nHe asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher and a chaperone .\nThe group decides it is safe to ski that day .\nBy 10 15 a.m. , they are on the trailhead to the pass , five kilometres away , described by backcountry enthusiasts as an easy , but beautiful trail .\nThey ski through forest , along a rocky creek , over a snow-covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley .\nSurrounded by mountains and deep powder snow , the scenery is breathtaking .\nReminders of past avalanches are everywhere .\nRelentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over the years have littered the area with rocks and stumps .\nFoliage is sparse on the valley floor .\nThe school group successfully crosses four avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley , and three on the south side .\nThey note that the debris from one avalanche path across the valley is no more than a week old .\nThey are halfway to their destination .\n\\*\\*\\* The guide s frantic warning comes too late .\nThe avalanche hits them head on .\nIn a matter of seconds , all 17 skiers are swept away in a huge , terrifying tangle of snow , rocks and trees .\nThe swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds , Abby thinks .\nA huge roar .\nThe power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way .\n.\n.\n.\nNobody could have got out of the way .\nNobody .\nThe river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers , then separates them .\nA section of the slide breaks away and keeps going , carrying a number of victims hundreds of metres down the valley .\nDisoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to swim to the surface , this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 metres beneath the concrete-hard snow .\nUp in the trees , Abby and Rich are dusted by a thick cloud of powder .\nA terrible silence falls over the valley .\nThough their hearts are thumping , they shut down their emotions .\nOn goes the search-and-rescue switch , one they have trained for years to put into practice .\nThey race down to the first group of buried skiers .\nThe only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow .\nThe others , in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley , are buried much deeper .\nAlone at the scene , the husband-and-wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions .\nWho to save first ?\nNot everybody would make it , they reason .\nBut those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival .\nRich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging .\nIt s Andrew Nicholson .\nHe finds Mr. Nicholson s shovel so the group leader can dig himself out , and moves on .\nMr. Nicholson has a satellite phone and calls for help .\nBut for the next 45 minutes , except for the victims , Rich and Abby are there by themselves , working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow .\nThe guides transceivers work perfectly , honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons , like shouts from the grave .\nThe couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork .\nOnly dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing .\nClear snow from the victim s face .\nNo CPR before moving on to the next victim .\nThere are too many .\nLet survivors dig themselves out .\nOnce free , the numb and distraught living do their best to help .\nTaylor Carcasole is frantic .\nHis best friend Michael Shaw is missing .\nWhere s Michael ?\nWhere s Michael ?\nThe victims are scattered beneath the snow .\nRich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible .\nThe first five people they pull out survive .\nThose survivors go on to rescue others .\nEveryone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead .\nThe grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over .\nSeven students make it .\nSeven do not .\nAn hour after the avalanche , seven helicopters , three dogs and more than 30 individuals are on site .\nBy 1 30 p.m. , the final victim has been dug out .\nOne survivor , with a broken ankle , is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital .\nThe remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden s station .\nThe bodies go , too .\nThey are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building .\nChuck Purse , Revelstoke s part-time coroner , is investigating his second seven-death avalanche within two weeks .\nHe examines each body in turn .\nNone show signs of major injury .\nThey were simply swept away and buried , dying from asphyxiation .\nThe bodies are wrapped in blankets , put in body bags and taken to the local Brandon Bowers Funeral Chapel .\nCo-owner Gary Sulz sends ordinary vans to collect the bodies because he thinks the sight of a fleet of hearses will upset the survivors .\nBack in Calgary , news of the tragedy begins rippling through the close-knit community of parents by late afternoon .\nDonna and Dave Broshko are just leaving for evening mass when Strathcona - Tweedsmuir head Tony Macoun calls to tell them there s been an accident .\nHe says there are fatalities .\nHe doesn t say who has died .\nMrs. Broshko immediately phones Ben Albert s mother , Carol Neale .\nBen and Scott have been classmates since elementary school .\nCarol , have you heard ?\nThere s been an accident .\nWhat are you talking about ?\nNo !\nshe screams .\nI told him I didn t want him to go .\n.\n.\nI didn t want him to go .\nAt the Arato home , Peter , skiing that weekend at Big White in Kelowna , B. C. , is talking to his wife when her cellphone rings .\nA friend has heard news reports of a tragedy where their son Daniel was skiing .\nMr. Arato soon learns from the radio that seven are dead from a school near Okotoks , where his boy s school is .\nHe thinks the odds will not be in his favor .\nThe parents are told to go to the school .\nJudith Arato makes the 30-kilometre drive alone .\nShe calls Peter in hysterics .\nDaniel is dead .\nMr. Arato s friends charter a plane and send him home .\nCarol Neale s worst fears are confirmed the moment she arrives at Strathcona - Tweedsmuir .\nAs she steps inside the foyer , another mother stops her .\nI ve heard from my son , she tells Ms. Neale , relief written all over her face .\nI haven t heard from my son , replies Ms. Neale .\nMinutes later , Tony Macoun tells her why .\nBen is dead .\nMrs. Broshko , meanwhile , is panic-stricken , a horrible sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach .\nShe can t stand not knowing .\nShe phones the RCMP in Revelstoke .\nNo luck .\nShe phones Glacier Park Lodge , begging a clerk to go across the highway where the survivors are to see if her Scotty is alive .\nOh , please , please , please , go across the road for me .\nI will be forever in your debt .\nTell me that my son is there .\nThe woman agrees .\nShe phones back .\nNo one will tell her anything .\nFinally , the anguished couple head for the school .\nThey are ushered in to see Mr. Macoun .\nIt s such a tragedy , he begins .\nI don t want to hear about the tragedy .\nJust tell me about Scott , Mrs. Broshko says .\nMr. Macoun says I m very sorry .\nScott s gone .\nThat night , Donna Broshko sleeps with a picture of Scott and her taken just before he went to the school s formal Christmas dance .\nHe is wearing his dad s suit and tie .\nHis father wore the same suit and tie at Scott s funeral on Thursday .\nSkiers are soon back on the same Connaught Creek trail where last week s avalanche claimed its bright young victims .\nThey ask offhandedly about the morgue , worried that the jagged debris may be tricky to cross .\nNot far from the trailhead lies a wreath , with two ski poles stuck upright in the snow .\nNames of the dead 15-year-olds -- Jeff Trickett , Scott Broshko , Daniel Arato , Ben Albert , Marissa Staddon , Michael Shaw and Alex Pattillo -- are listed on the wreath , with the epigraph Your Youth Will Be Eternal .\nFarther along the path one glimpses a more sombre memorial the deadly toe of the avalanche .\nAt the bottom of the valley are three pits .\nThey are several metres deep , a metre across , and not far apart .\nThree burial holes left behind , and no one has filled them in .\nTimetable of tragedy On Saturday , Feb. 1 , 14 Grade 10 students from Strathcona - Tweedsmuir School south of Calgary , set out on a backcountry ski trip up the Balu Pass in Glacier National Park , B. C. At around 11 45 a.m. , they were caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them .\nHere is the sequence of events on that day .\n1 .\nBefore departing , the leaders checked with the National Park staff for current avalanche conditions .\nThey were advised that the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line and considerable above it .\nStudents were equipped with personal avalanche beacons , probes and shovels .\nAt 8 40 a.m. , students left A. O. Wheeler Hut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Centre , where they conducted at least one test for avalanche risk .\n2 .\n10 15 a.m. Commencement of trip up the Balu Pass trail .\nFollowing standard procedure , the one teacher led and the other adult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers , who were 15 metres from each other .\n3 .\n11 45 a.m. . About halfway up the valley , an avalanche slid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group .\nTwo skiers about 200 metres ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contacted wardens by satellite phone .\n12 30 p.m. Six students were reported alive .\n12 45 p.m. Wardens arrive .\n4 .\n1 30 p.m. All students were accounted for , including the seven who lost their lives .\n1.45 p.m. . One of the students was tobogganed back to the motel with a broken ankle .\nMeanwhile , helicopters joined the rescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot , from where they were transported to a private home in Revelstoke .\nHow the avalanche happened A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain , above the south side of Connaught Creek Valley .\nThis set off a huge second slide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that it rode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward down the valley , burying the group of skiers .\n-- The Globe and Mail .\nRepublished with permission .\nAll Rights Reserved .\nNo part of this article may be reproduced or republished or redistributed without the prior written consent of the copyright holder .\nSATURDAY SPECIAL How a carefully planned adventure to the B.

Lonnie is a perfect example of a PLB user , said ACR s Paul Hardin , executive vice president .\nHe spends years preparing for an epic adventure to assure his success and survival .\nThough he never plans to use a PLB , it is an essential part of his contingency plan .\nShould he ever need Search and Rescue SAR assistance , the use of a PLB minimizes the cost of rescue and risk to SAR personnel as the technology takes the search out of Search and Rescue , Hardin says .\nFor more information www .\nOne World Expedition.com , www .\nACRelectronics.com .\nON THE HORIZON Time in a Bottle In a forlorn location by a busy highway in Flushing Meadows Park in Queens , N. Y. , lie buried 50 feet underground two missile-shaped time capsules from the 1939-40 and 1964-65 World s Fairs .\nJammed with memorabilia , the two capsules were intended to survive 5,000 years of rot and oxidation and then be opened by God - Knows - Who-or - What in the Year of Our Lord 6939 .\nA bit more realistic time frame is planned for the Explorers Club time capsule which will be filled with artifacts and memorabilia that represent the past 100 years of exploration .\nFor $ 150 , those who contribute will have their name on a roll enclosed in the sealed capsule .\nThe closing ceremony is planned for Dec. 17 during the Club s Centennial Ball in New York .\nFor more information www .\nExplorers.org .\nDEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS Not that Climbing Magazine , the Other One Our headline last month was a bit misleading .\nOutward Bound USA has partnered with Urban Climber magazine , not Climbing magazine .\nEXPEDITION CLASSIFIEDS Expedition Public Relations Alex Foley Associates specializes in international public relations for explorers , expeditions and adventure challenges creating maximum value for title sponsors .\nAlexandra Foley is a dual British - American citizen , Honorary Secretary of the British Chapter of the Explorers Club and a Fellow of The Royal Geographical Society .\nHer firm has executed PR programs for numerous expeditions including the Titanic 1996 Expedition , The Ice Challenger Bering Strait Expedition , Will Cross s Novolog Ultimate Trek to Cure Diabetes , David Hempleman Adams s Chase de Vere , Bank of Ireland and Uniq Atlantic Balloon Challenges , and his solo and unsupported trek to the Geomagnetic North Pole , and Rosie Stancer s Snickers South Pole Solo Challenge .\nAlex Foley Associates Ltd. .

C. They had stopped for tea in some timber at 5,500 feet , and as they stood sipping from thermoses , they could see the students about 300 feet below , a twisting line of earth tones in their Gore - Tex jackets and snug hats slowly ascending the same broken trail that Marshall and Watkins had skied .\nAt 11 45 , as Marshall was closing his thermos , he heard a sharp crack from across the valley , from the menacing north-facing slope of Mount Cheops , a peak considered too steep to ski .\nMarshall saw the snowpack at approximately 7,900 feet give way and begin a screaming descent toward the students and their guides .\nAvalanche !\nAvalanche !\nAvalanche !\nhe yelled .\nThe students had only seconds before the monstrous slide , estimated at more than 850 yards wide and moving with enough force to flatten 10 acres of forest , hit .\nFirst came a wall of snow , one student later told wardens , and then blackness .\nMarshall and Watkins were dusted by the avalanche and waited for it to settle before speeding toward the group .\nInvestigators would later conclude that the couple saved at least five lives .\nBut there would be little solace in that fact .\nWhile seven youngsters and three adults survived the avalanche , another seven motivated and promising teenagers -- six boys and one girl -- died .\nAs funerals were held last week , much of what Calgary learned about the lost students came from thumbnail sketches in the newspapers .\nBen Albert was a hockey and volleyball player ; Daniel Arato , an eccentric who rode a unicycle ; Scott Broshko , a trumpet player and four-sport athlete ; Alex Patillo , a lover of the theater ; Michael Shaw , a computer whiz who favored sailing ; Jeff Trickett , a witty saxophone player ; and Marissa Staddon , a figure skater who loved climbing with her father .\nThe loss of young life leveled the community and sparked a debate over the value of outdoor programs at schools like Strathcona - Tweedsmuir -- a debate that was played out , wrenchingly , even at the victims funerals .\nWhat kind of character are we trying to build by this type of adventure -- Rambos ?\nsaid Arato s grandfather , John Konig , during the service for his grandson .\nThe next day 17-year-old Amanda Shaw , Michael s older sister , stepped to the podium at Christ Church and gave STS a much-needed vote of confidence .\nNobody could have predicted it ; nobody could have prevented it , said Amanda , who went on an earlier Rogers Pass trip .\nIt s a great character-building program .\nParks Canada has come under fire as well .\nOn Jan. 20 an avalanche on the Durrand Glacier , 20 miles from Rogers Pass , had buried 13 skiers and snowboarders , killing seven .\nAmong the dead were four Americans -- Kathleen Kessler of Truckee , Calif. ; Dennis Yates of Los Angeles ; Ralph Lunsford of Littleton , Colo. ; and world-champion snowboarder Craig Kelly of Mount Vernon , Wash. .\nThe death toll for these two avalanches is equal to the average number of avalanche deaths in Canada for the past five winters .\nSays Peter Arato , Daniel s father , When a tragedy is called an accident , it implies it was unavoidable .\nBut what happens in life is never that black and white .\nThere is no gray when it comes to how Canadians feel about their right to explore their national parks .\nWhile there is no way to track the number of Canadians who venture into the wild , it is clear that number is growing rapidly , said Ross Cloutier , a mountain guide who chairs the adventure programs department at University College of the Cariboo in Kamloops , B. C. It is what this generation wants to do .\nThe most recent avalanche has spurred Parks Canada to review how it keeps adventurers safe , but parks officials and outdoor enthusiasts scoff at taking more-radical steps such as closing areas deemed hazardous .\nYou can t regulate the backcountry , says Cloutier .\nYou can t lock it up .\nThe controversy swirling around the school programs won t pass easily .\nWhether the 14 STS students should have been on the mountain has been debated not only during eulogies but also in classrooms and at dinner tables , in the Irish pubs on Calgary s bustling 8th Avenue and in mountain towns such as Revelstoke , B. C. , home to the coroner who has investigated all 14 deaths in this year s two avalanches .\nOutdoor excursions at STS and at other schools across Canada have been canceled or postponed as officials and families ponder whether learning the lessons that nature teaches is worth putting children in harm s way .\nHow this debate goes will determine if mountain adventure programs are viable , said Dan Murphy , principal at Banff Alberta Mountain Academy , which canceled some trips after Feb. 1 .\nWe can only hope , says Alf Skrastins , director of outdoor programs at the University of Calgary , that the people doing the criticizing understand the role nature can play in children s lives .\nThat role is defined early at Strathcona - Tweedsmuir .\nInitiation for first-grade students includes a weekend during which they sleep in tents on campus , which covers 170 acres in the eastern foothills of the Rockies .\nThey learn environmental tenets such as leave it as you found it and are introduced to places on campus where they can hike , ski , canoe , rock climb or otherwise explore .\nHigh school and junior high students participate in trips of several days , such as the excursion to Rogers Pass , which was part of a for-credit course for 10th-graders .\nThe outdoor education program has made such a difference , says Christine Kolanos , a former member of the school s volunteer board who sent all four of her children to STS .\nIt teaches students the drive , desire and dedication needed to succeed in life .\nAll those attributes were possessed by the 14 students who left Calgary on the last day of January .\nThe teenagers also appear to have been well versed on the potential dangers in Glacier National Park .\nOn Friday , as the group s vans rode the four hours to Rogers Pass , they passed avalanche warning signs and went through five long tunnels built because constant slides had buried the highway .\nOnce in Rogers Pass , the students skied for 20 minutes from the highway to A. O. Wheeler Hut , a three-bedroom log cabin maintained by the Alpine Club of Canada .\nThat afternoon they skied near the cabin , and -- supervised by Andrew Nicholson and Dale Roth , avalanche-certified teachers -- they dug avalanche pits , did snowpack testing and performed compression tests on every slope .\nThey set out storm boards to collect the overnight snowfall and in the morning compared the samples with the snow already on the ground .\nThey then skied to the visitors center , where Nicholson talked with officials about snow conditions and was given a daily bulletin that included weather conditions , satellite imagery and avalanche danger ratings .\nThe report for Feb. 1 stated that below the tree line , where the group planned to stay , avalanche danger was Moderate -- Natural avalanches are unlikely .\nHuman triggers are possible .\nHowever , their route offered no protection if an avalanche occurred in the alpine areas above them , which included the 8,550-foot peak of Mount Cheops .\nIn the alpine areas the threat was deemed Considerable -- Natural avalanches are possible .\nHuman triggers are probable .\nThe guides conferred with the students , who , according to school officials , wanted to ski for Balu .\nNicholson and Roth made the final decision to proceed .\nThey were headed up a valley in Glacier National Park , one of the most unstable areas in Western Canada .\nThe Canadian army routinely fires howitzers in Rogers Pass in an attempt to trigger controlled avalanches and keep the highway and railways clear .\nLayers of snow packed in the last few months had done little to lessen the threat of avalanches .\nA Jan. 20 layer easily released during tests , according to the daily report given to Nicholson .\nA Dec. 6 layer suffered compression test failures .\nWorst of all was the deep November layer .\nTwo laminated crusts of ice sandwiched a layer of unstable crystals to form a sort of snow plywood that had worried avalanche watchers all winter .\nEvery year the snowpack is questionable up there , says John Seibert , an experienced backcountry ski-mountaineer from Alaska who survived the Jan. 20 avalanche on the Durrand Glacier , but that s the risk .\nAnd to learn about yourself , you have to take risks .\nBefore the trip students had completed fitness tests and lessons in avalanche awareness and rescue .\nDuring the ascent , they followed the standard practice for traveling in avalanche zones of maintaining spacing between skiers , in this case keeping 30 to 50 feet between pairs .\nAnd about15 minutes into the trip the guides stopped the column and quizzed each student on avalanche safety protocol .\nThey were as prepared as they could have been , says Ingrid Healy , assistant head of school at STS .\nAs anyone could have been .\nThe wind was blowing less than 16 mph at the tree line , but it was stronger at the top of Mount Cheops , where it had been blowing between 20 mph and 45 mph all week .\nAt 11 45 a.m. something , perhaps the weight of snow blown over the shoulder of the mountain , became too much for the January layer , and it cracked and slid down the mountain .\nBy itself it would have merely dusted the valley beneath it -- something the STS group could tell friends about upon their return .\nBut the weight was too much for the Dec. 6 layer to hold , and the two layers combined heft easily cracked the fragile November crust , sending approximately 1,000 tons of snow into the valley .\nWe see an avalanche of that magnitude 3.5 out of 5 at least once a year , but usually not in that pass , says Eric Dafoe , a public safety coordinator for Parks Canada , and usually during a big storm period , when no one is around .\nThe snow hit Nicholson first , pushing him toward where Marshall and Watkins stood .\nMarshall located Nicholson quickly because one of his arms was exposed .\nAfter freeing him enough to allow him to begin digging himself out , Marshall skied down to help Watkins .\nWhen we arrived down at the debris , we saw just about everybody was buried , Watkins told Global TV affiliate CHAN in Vancouver .\nWe just started moving toward signs of life -- a ski glove -- and digging , finding a face , making sure they re breathing and then moving on .\nEach student carried a shovel and a probe and wore an avalanche beacon , which emits a beeping signal that can be received by another beacon .\nThe closer Watkins got to a buried student , the louder and more frequent the beeps .\nShe and Marshall moved quickly , but some of the group had tumbled more than 200 yards down the valley .\nOnce free , some of the rescued began trying to dig out their friends .\nNicholson , who was carrying a satellite phone , called the Rogers Pass warden , and within 40 minutes 10 rescuers were on the scene .\nThe number grew quickly to 40 -- including park staff , mountain guides , military personnel and heli-ski guides .\nAmong the last group were staff members from the Selkirk Mountain Experience , whose owner , Ruedi Beglinger , led the tragic Jan. 20 expedition on the Durrand Glacier .\nBut seven of the students had been buried too deep .\nIt would be an hour and 20 minutes from the time the avalanche hit before the last body was lifted from its grasp .\nThey were just in the wrong place at the wrong time , says Dafoe .\nIn the days following the disaster , grieving parents questioned the decision to go for Balu .\nIf the chances of an avalanche were considerable just above where the students were to ski , why take the risk ?\nSTS head Tony Macoun insists that the risks were weighed by all .\nThis was not a case of the leaders dictating what would happen , he says .\nBut are teenagers mature enough and informed enough to weigh the risks inherent in such a decision ?\nThe criticism from Arato s family made the front pages of newspapers across Canada , as did Amanda Shaw s defense of the STS program and of Nicholson .\nHe didn t want to take a risk for anything , she said .\nIn the following days other family members showed support for the school s program and the decision to go for Balu .\nI am at peace with the decision to proceed with the trip that day , said Karl Staddon , Marissa s father .\nAt the same time , at least one of the victims families has reportedly talked to an attorney about filing a lawsuit .\nParks Canada and STS are the likely defendants , but such a suit might do little more than extend the grief .\nA change in Canadian law in November eliminated potential earnings as a reward in civil filings , meaning that the pain of reliving the event would net each family only about U. S. $ 50,000 .\nEveryone looks for someone to blame , whether it s for the avalanches or the space shuttle , says Seibert , the survivor of the Jan. 20 slide .\nWe have this belief that safety is guaranteed , and that is ludicrous .\nI hope that if something had happened to me , my wife would have been happy knowing I didn t die watching CNN .\nThat same mind-set is what administrators at Strathcona - Tweedsmuir remain determined to cultivate in the school s students .\nWe will be investigating and likely adding procedures for risk assessment , but this program is at the heart of who we are and how we educate and develop young people , Healy says .\nIt won t end .\nIssue date February 17 , 2003 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ PLEASE VISIT http \\/ \\/ www.canada.com\\/vancouver Many more stories at the web site .\nRescue workers dug two hours to find buried teens Greg Middleton The Province ;

with files from Canadian Press Sunday , February 02 , 2003 REVELSTOKE -- The second deadly avalanche to hit this area in as many weeks has claimed the lives of seven high school students from Alberta on a back-country ski excursion .\nDead are six boys and one girl , all Grade 10 students at Strathcona - Tweedsmuir School , a small private school in Okotoks , about 20 kilometres south of Calgary .\nRCMP said 14 students from the school , out on an annual cross-country ski trip , were among 17 people caught in the slide late yesterday morning in this popular ski-touring area in east-central B. C. B. C. Ambulance Service spokesman Bob Pierce confirmed the deaths .\nThe survivors were airlifted to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter .\nTwo people from the group were treated for minor injuries , said RCMP Sgt.\nRandy Brown .\nWhen the call for help came in from a cell phone , park wardens , RCMP officers and local ski-tour operators and guides , backed up by helicopters and search dogs , joined in the rescue effort .\nMembers of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche-control work were also on hand to assist .\nThe slide occurred in Glacier National Park , about 65 kilometres east of Revelstoke , in the Rogers Pass area known as Knock Creek .\nThe victims were in an outdoor education class , said Pam Doyle , superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke .\nAll three leaders of the group -- two male teachers and a male volunteer -- had certification and back-country experience , Macoun added .\nThe group had been skiing about 15 metres apart , with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear .\nThe skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope , burying nearly the entire group .\nSeveral mountain guides out recreational skiing witnessed the slide and raced over to help .\nNothing like this has ever happened here before , said John Jones , longtime manager of the Glacier Park Lodge .\nIt s devastating , of course .\nA lot of the people who ski here know people involved in the last avalanche .\nIt s a double blow .\nLast night , teary-eyed children at a local hotel could be heard placing frantic calls home to assure parents they were safe .\nParents began arriving last night .\nYesterday s slide , 500 to 800 metres wide , was the second major slide in the area in a month .\nSeven people in a party of 21 back-country skiers died in a Jan. 20 avalanche on Durrand Glacier . .\nThe avalanche yesterday occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon .\nDoyle said it swept the north face of the mountain in the Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley , about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit .\nThe area is not particularly remote and features well-marked cross-country ski trails .\nNo guides are needed to ski in the area .\nIt s a very , very popular ski destination site , said Pat Dunn , media liaison officer at the national park .\nThe Saturday-morning back-country avalanche report listed the hazard for the park as considerable in both the treeline and alpine areas .\nDoyle said there are no plans yet to close back-country areas of the park .\nEvan Manners , operations manager of the Canadian Avalanche Centre here , said yesterday s avalanche rating was about half way along the five-level rating system .\nBut he added it was ideal conditions for an avalanche -- clear conditions just after a storm system passed through the area .\nStatistically , this is exactly the time when we see the majority of accidents in the few days following a storm , Manners said .\nManners added that two significant slides in such a short period is not unusual .\nWhether the circumstances surrounding the avalanche that swept down the mountainside yesterday near Rogers Pass is any different than those during the killer avalanche two weeks ago is uncertain .\nWhat is clear is that an average of 13 people die in avalanches every year in Canada , mostly in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and B. C. The death toll , and the promise of more to come as the popularity of backcountry touring grows , is raising questions about what can be done to avert accidents .\nResearchers , backcountry enthusiasts , and mountain guides argue the government must spend more money to research avalanches .\nBut others suggest that it is simply too difficult to predict when and where an avalanche will take place .\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* 7 Students Die in Canadian Avalanche THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REVELSTOKE , British Columbia -- Another avalanche in a region of eastern British Columbia killed seven skiers Saturday -- all of them high-school students , authorities said .\nThe dead were six boys and one girl , all in grade 10 at the Strathcona - Tweedsmuir School , a private institution about 12 miles south of Calgary , Alberta .\nWe are absolutely stricken with grief .\nOur hearts go out to all those who are impacted , said Tony Macoun , head of the school .\nThere were 17 people in the school group , three adults and 14 students in an outdoor education class , on their annual cross-country ski trip .\nThe leaders of the group were two male teachers and a male volunteer .\nAll three leaders had certification and backcountry experience , Macoun said .\nThe 10 survivors were airlifted to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter , said Bob Pearce of the British Columbia Ambulance Service .\nOne was hospitalized and some others suffered minor injuries , a Glacier Park spokesperson said .\nNames and further details about the victims were not available until next of kin could be notified .\nThe slide occurred just before noon Saturday in the Rogers Pass area of Glacier National Park in western Canada .\nThe avalanche , which ran for about a mile , was capable of destroying 10 acres of forest , said Pat Dunn , a Parks Canada spokeswoman .\nTwo mountain guides , who had just passed the students , saw the avalanche and warned them before it hit , park warden Jordy Shepherd said .\nThey were the first to help dig the victims out after the slide engulfed the group .\nSome victims were buried under about 9 feet of snow , Dunn said .\nAs many as seven helicopters helped in the rescue effort .\nIt was second major avalanche in the Revelstoke area in 12 days .\nA Jan. 20 avalanche in the same region killed seven people -- four Canadians and three Americans , including snowboard pioneer Craig Kelly .\nA memorial service for those victims was held Friday .\nShow Another Report\n\nWestwide Accident Report Database\n\n',046

By Galeo Saintz - Oct 2003 There is just something about Boven - the vista from the camp site , the easy access to climbs and the pure vibe of the place - surely make it South Africa s premier sport climbing destination ; coupled with a good density of climbs and unlimited further potential , it is the ideal place to hold a climbing festival .\nOur group of young climbers arrived a couple of days before the event , to warm up , check out the crags and get familiar again with our favorite climbs .\nHaving spent many weekends at Boven over the years and having noticed in the last while a distinct reduction in the number of climbers pitching at crags and camp site , it was a welcome surprise to have the old vibe back , loads of climbers from the experienced to the beginner .\nThe festival kicked off on the Friday evening .\nAlready by the afternoon though people were pulling in from everywhere ; Cape Town , Nelspruit , Pretoria , even Natal .\nSlack-lines were strung , hammocks stretched between trees and familiar faces reaffirmed the uniqueness and magic of climbing friendships .\nFriday evening got going with a slide show on the remarkable rock art of the region presented by Conraad de Roser of Bongani Lodge on the border of Kruger National Park .\nThis slide show reminded all present that rock climbers were not the first to visit some of these awesome crags , but that the bushmen were here long before us , their many rock paintings at the base of some of Boven s most famous climbs are testament to the spiritual potency of the place .\nFor all we know some of their images on the rock may well be route descriptions we have overlooked just imagine Eraserhead may have been climbed for the first time some 80 000 years ago and not in the closing decades of the 20th century .\nConraad s presentation certainly put things into perspective and reminded us that some of the places we climb are sacred sites to ancient people and as such hold significant ritual history , just something to be aware of the next time we stand at the base of a climb and put our shoes on a slowly vanishing piece of our cultural heritage .\nIn good spirit the evening rounded off with a drumming circle around a mighty fire .\nDrumming out a rhythm on a Yembe is one way of getting a good flow of blood to the chalky digits ; I have to attribute the quick healing of my raw fingertips to this primal form of communal expression .\nIt was good fun .\nSaturday morning was slow , climbers emerging from countless scattered tents and chalets , the smell of coffee drifting from one group to another .\nThe rally was only scheduled to start at 11 AM so all and sundry were taking it easy , devising our strategy and selecting the routes most likely to score the most points based on the handicap system chosen .\nThis was calculated by adding the following The total of best red point ever + best on-sight ever + best red point in last 6 months + best on-sight in last 6 months , divided by 4 to give an average grade .\nIf you climbed this grade during the rally you scored 70 points , any routes climbed above or below your handicap grade subtract or add 10 points for each grade .\nEach route then had a number of bonus points allocated depending on the grade of the route and the traveling distance to reach it .\nFlashing the route scored an extra 10 bonus points .\nBy Midday the teams were off , groups of two s running in every direction .\nThe climbing was unbelievable , thanks to the weather the Due to the scoring method the most effective way to really accumulate a good number of points was to climb as many easy routes as fast as possible at as many different crags as possible .\nNo easy feat .\nThe advantage for me , of course , was that I had the opportunity to get onto a vast amount of routes below grade 19 that I had simply never considered climbing before .\nAnd myself being a climber who prefers on-sighting to red-pointing , I found great satisfaction in this .\nAt each of the crags there was great competitive spirit and immense camaraderie .\nI can t remember the last time I climbed at The Coven where almost every climb had someone on it .\nOf course the area has experienced a certain amount crime in the past , but the tourism monitors ?\nwere out in force , keeping an eye out for any undesirable company , yet keeping a good distance from the climbing itself , allowing one to feel safe and yet not intruded upon .\nThere is also certain satisfaction knowing that climbing through this program is creating employment of some kind and that the more people from different communities who come together to realize the value of climbing as a sport , the better for all involved .\nAlthough we thought we had a strategy that rocked , my partner and I , by the middle of the first day , realized we had way over-shot our ability to complete the number of routes chosen - you know you have been pushing yourself when you start falling off routes two grades below your handicap because your forearms are cramping .\nOh the sorrow , when you know you are on a 19 climb yet it feels like a 25 .\nNothing compared though to the exhilaration of pushing through and reaching the top anchors .\nOne more route in the bag - time to crash back across winding paths , up hill , down hill rushing to beat the cut-off time .\n10 points were deducted for each minute you arrived late .\nSaturday night saw the festival really kick off loads of braaing everywhere , another slide show , this time on climbing and then live music .\nPity the main music event was scheduled for the Saturday evening ; everyone was so trashed and needing to recover for the second half of the rally the following day , that any party was almost too much .\nBut hey , all the hard-core guys managed to pack it in .\nAfter all , this entire event is about endurance .\nSunday saw an early start , by 7am we were hitting the crags again .\nThe sun was already blazing , today we needed more water than chalk , more sun block than cranking power .\nHallucinogen crag was packed , whatever sequence of climbs we had planned was quickly tossed down into the valley ; today we would simply have to climb whatever we could get onto and instead of waiting for a climb , simply run to the next closest available , even if it was a grade 14 - for which we still scored bonus points and on-sight points .\nOn returning to the finish by 1pm , there was not a single face amongst all the climbers that wasn t a mixtureof sweat , exhaustion and sheer happiness , the kind that comes after spending a good day pushing your body to its limits , scaling the most awesome rock in the country and being around good friends .\nIn my opinion this was a really successful rock rally and the prize giving said it all .\nClimbing gear manufacturers and retailers really came to the party ; the sheer volume and quality of the prizes , I think , took everyone by surprise .\nAlthough the winners walked away with new ropes and harnesses and a basket of other goodies valued at a small fortune , it wasn t about what you could win , but that all present had won a rally like this is about the spirit of climbing and what it means to just have a damn good time with a group of damn fine people .\nEd Feb , certainly the most indomitable personality on the SA climbing scene , walked away with the prize for the greatest winger and took it hands down .\nGood on you Ed - your presence adds humor and gets things moving .\nClinton Martinengo walked off with best on-sights - two 26 s and a 27 .\nThe highest number of points went to the local guys , the big wall endurance team of Mark Seuring and Alard Hufner , not only did they climb an impressive number of routes but also managed to visit over 9 different crags , no mean achievement that , let me tell you , all those long walk-ins to remote big walls certainly seemed to pay off for this team .\nTo me the overall winner was no team in particular .\nThe real winner of this event was sport climbing in Boven .\nTo the team that pulled it all together , thanks to you and all the climbers ; there was not a single accident or mishap , the campsite wasn t trashed and there was no crime .\nThanks for putting Boven on the map as a climbing festival destination and thanks for the most enjoyable weekend I have had in a long time .\nTo those that didn t make it , make it next time - because it is a rally like this that makes you feel proud of being a climber , it is a rally like this that helps grow the sport and foster new friendships , it is a rally like this that reminds you why you started sport climbing in the first place - to be with great friends , in an awesome location with some of the finest rock around - just a little reminder of how fortunate we are to live and climb in Africa GATEWAY SPEED HEIGHT RECORDS By Garth Hattingh - Sep 2002 Durbanites set three new world speed and distance climbing records between 5pm Friday 13th and 5pm Saturday 14th on The Rock Climbing Wall in Gateway Theatre of Shopping - at 23 meters , the highest permanent indoor climbing wall in the world .\nIn this event , the climber s had to climb The Rock on a top-roped belay to get their feet above a designated 20-meter mark , then lower off to ground , and repeat this obviously hundreds of times !\nThe teams not only climbed , but also belayed one another .\nThe solo climber was allowed to use other climbers to belay him .\nOne team of four climbers , The 180 Degree Adventure Team , set up a new 24-hour record height of 11111m eleven thousand , one hundred and eleven meters , climbing in turn virtually without rest .\nThis involved climbing 550 times up and down The Rock some 138 times each .\nThe average time per cimb was under two minutes .\nThe team consisted of Erin Adams , Trent Burnett , Dave Drummond , and Benjamin Herr .\nAnother team , The Rock Team , went for the Sea Level to Top of Everest record , a height of 8848m .\nThey accomplished this in 17 hours and 27 minutes - each member climbing over 100 times , at an average of well under two minutes per climb up and down .\nThe team consisted of Dale Boucher , Willem Fourie , Nic Geere , and Matthew Gibbon .\nA solo climber , Mark Kojetin , climbed 3848m in the 24 hours - the height from Everest Base Camp to Summit , thereby setting up another record .\nThese performances can comfortably be equated to extreme heights of endeavor in any other endurance sport or activity .\nIt is almost certain that these strictly monitored and noteworthy efforts will all find their rightful place in the Guinness World Record Book .\nThe challenge is there , folks - any contenders ?\nAROUSAL ANXIETY IN ROCK CLIMBING By Greg Streatfield 2002 Rock climbing is an inherently dangerous sport .\nTherefore , the sport is naturally a conducive to the experience of arousal and anxiety in its participants .\nArousal and anxiety are concepts often used interchangeably .\nHowever , in many instances they mean entirely different things .\nWeinberg and Gould 1995 define arousal as the degree of activation of the organs and mechanisms that are under control of the body s autonomic nervous system .\nAnxiety , in its simplest form can be defined as the subjective feeling of apprehension and heightened arousal Weinberg Gould , 1995 .\nFrom personal experience , I have often wondered why some days I can get totally gripped climbing on an easy sport route , yet on other days I can lead a hard trad route and feel no anxiety at all , even though the danger of injury is far greater .\nI am sure many of you out there have had exactly the same experiences .\nA psychological model , known as Reversal theory may be able to explain these experiences .\nReversal Theory has been used to explain many kinds of non-rational behavior , including soccer hooliganism .\nThe basic idea of Reversal Theory is that there are a number of separate and identifiable ways in which we all experience the world .\nAs we pass through our everyday lives , we move between these different experiential states .\nWe are all , as it were , different people at different times .\nThese states , known in Reversal Theory as metamotivational states , have three related characteristics 1 They originate from a basic psychological desire or value , 2 They are each associated with their own range of emotions , and 3 They each involve seeing the world in their own way .\nReversal Theory maintains that each of these metamotivational states is found in pairs of opposites .\nTherefore , change consists of movement between members of each pair , with only one of them functioning at a time .\nThese switches between pairs are called reversals .\nAlthough situations and events play a part in determining a person s metamotivational state at any given time , psychological aspects within the person are also relevant .\nThe effect of this is that a person can be in the same situation at different times ; yet experience it differently , therefore behaving differently as well .\nFour pairs of metamotivational states are found .\nThese are the telic-paratelic , negativistic-conformist , mastery-sympathy and autic-alloic Kerr , 1997 .\nThe telic-paratelic and negativistic-conformist form the somatic emotions and the transactional emotions are formed by the combination of autic-alloic and mastery - sympathy .\nThe somatic emotions are important in the way in which individuals experience arousal Kerr , 1997 .\nThe transactional emotions are as a result of an individual s experience of the degree to which he or she has lost or gained in an interaction Kerr , 1997 .\nThe telic-paratelic metamotivational states pair is the most important in explaining the experiences of arousal and anxiety in rock climbing refer to Figure 1 .\nThe telic state is a serious-minded state in which the individual sees himself or herself as engaged in some purposeful activity , which is important beyond itself .\nThe paratelic state is a playful state in which the ongoing activity is engaged in for its own sake , for the immediate enjoyment , which it can provide .\nThe basic desire in the telic state is for some significant achievement , while in the paratelic state the desire is to have fun with immediate gratification .\nEach state has a different range of emotions .\nIn the telic state there is a range from relaxation to anxiety , and in the paratelic state , from boredom to excitement .\nIn the telic state , a person becomes anxious as arousal levels increase , but feels relaxed under low levels of arousal .\nIn the paratelic state , a person becomes more pleasantly excited as arousal levels increase , but bored if there is a lack of stimulation .\nSo how does explain the experiences I referred to earlier ?\nPeople who rock climb are expected to be dominant in the paratelic metamotivational state .\nDuring rock climbing , it is anticipated that there is a switch to the paratelic state , which is better equipped to deal with the type of arousal experienced .\nThe high arousal of a hard trad lead climb will be experienced as pleasant excitement .\nHowever , in the gripped scenario , on an easy sport route , due to internal psychological circumstances , the paratelic state has not been switched to , and therefore the experience of anxiety occurs .\nSimple So , is it possible to switch metamotivational states ?\nAt this stage , this is difficult to determine .\nResearch suggests that metamotivational states can be switched using mental imagery .\nHowever , at this stage the studies have not shown conclusive results , and you probably just need to let psychology run it course and the switch will naturally occur !\nReferences 1 Apter , M. 1998 .\nReversal theory What is it ?\nOn-line .\nAvailable http \\/ \\/ www.swin.edu.au\\/ssb\\/rt\\/bpapter.htm 2 Chapman , A.

been isolated and few and far between .\nEven the dreaded Waterfall Gorge area has been frequented a lot lately despite its obvious closeness to the township .\nSince BMW launched their new 745 series here at the tunnel and a bunch of money was donated to sponsor tourism development projects , crime has cooled down and tourists are now accompanied by guides and a guards look after cars at the tunnel , waterfall and bridge attractions .\nNow it seems as if those criminals are looking further into the hills to find their loot .\nThree incidents took place this weekend one on Saturday at the Coven and two on Monday at Hallucinogen Wall !\nWe were all just as shocked as you are to hear that they have not only made it all the way out there to Wonderland on foot to mug climbers at knifepoint , but also trespassed MCSA property in doing so .\nI received a call around 14h30 on Monday and immediately sent out five local guys also from Emgwenya , the local township to help us track these guys down in vein .\nThanks to the police , all the other climbers that waited while I was supposed to pick you up and the guys that helped looking out for the poor dudes that is now financially better of than their mates - more about that later .\nIn a meeting later Monday evening with some of the guys that got ripped off and my friends from the township we came up with a bunch of facts that all climbers should take note of These incidents could have been easily prevented if the climbers reported the young locals very neatly dressed and well spoken as suspicious characters .\nI am not pointing fingers here , the climbers admitted to have been to relaxed thinking that these locals looked as if they could have been from a school climbing club .\nThe result of these incidents is that climbers would unfortunately have to take a bit more care when going to crags in future .\nThe amounts of cash , cell phones etc that is now in the hands of the criminals will be encouraging them keep on going .\nSo ; Do not take valuables to the crags - there is a safe at Roc n Rope for wallets etc. .\nHide your cell phone under a bush and switch it off so that you can call someone in a medical emergency etc .\nTry to go in groups and take a big Jarvis-like character and or your viscous attack dog along !\nImmediately report wanderers lurking or without packs to the police on 013 257-0001 or to us on 013 257-0363 \\/ 082 753-3695 The police inspectors have been very helpful and have in the past recovered a bunch of stolen stuff .\nDo no underestimate these guys .\nThey respond quickly and rely on you to get detailed information to them as soon as possible .\nSome of the local guys that climb and work with us Thulani , in this case have redpointed up to grade 27 , opened routes and are just as determined to get to the bottom of our problem .\nThey know that crime will make people not visit the area and THEY WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS .\nSo in effect we have much more locals on our side than the couple of cowards running around with their little knives taking chances on the contents of your pack .\nIt is a small community and generally very friendly and honest .\nJust a couple of desperate and criminal minds amongst them .\nThe police officers ask that all cases be reported immediately .\nOfficially they suggest that no resistance should be offered and one should hand over anything they ask for .\nUnofficially .\nuhmmm , well yes . no. .\nIf you call 112 from a cell , ask for Waterval BOVEN police station - sometimes calls can go to Waterval station in the Northern Province .\nTry your best to identify suspects as far as scars and facial features , speech impediments , jewellery , clothing etc. .\nVisually follow the direction they flee in if you can get to an elevated spot .\nCall us at Roc n Rope .\nWe work with the police and will send informers to try and identify suspects .\nFor now , we are desperately working on plans to make sure that our guides are also climbing at the crags when you are there .\nThey will be marked with Roc n Rope Adventure shirts or jackets .\nAlso , I know I will not be harassed while my dog Ceaser or the local dog from the Shamrock Arms Julius is with me .\nThe rental fees include biscuits , biltong water !\nLastly , the climbing and weather here is too good to let this take the better of us .\nIf we all work together for a while and take precaution , justice will sort these guys out and we will have all 35 crags back again .\nPS We will carry stock of pepper spray , ninja knives , hand grenades and bazookas very soon !!!\nSPITZKOPPE By Alard H fner 2001 Mark Seuring , Steve Broccardo and myself spent a week in Namibia , 2 weeks ago , we were climbing at Spitzkoppe , we opened a new 14 pitch route to the right of INXS and to the right of the SW route , just to the left of Watersports and parallel to it , the next crack\\/corner up our route , named Everything in Moderation is graded at 25 . five of the pitches are bolted and the rest of the route follows a perfect layback hand-jamming crack with bomber gear .\nthe grade 25 pitch is a very wide flaring horizontal crack , it is about 7 meters long and bolted .\nVERY strenuous .\nThe top 4 pitches are good quality face climbing .\na 5 star route !!!\nSuperb !!\nWe also onsighted the standard route to the summit in hiking boots , and without the use of ropes gear or harnesses .\nmakes for an interesting descent .\nMCSA \\/ BMC MOZAMBIQUE EXPIDITION By Alard H fner 2001 We just got back from the joint MCSA \\/ BMC expedition to northern Mozambique .\nWe were successful in climbing our objective Sitting Chief local name Murupie .\nWe had quite an adventure getting there , 10 of us in 2 cars .\nOne car a double cab Toyota Hilux and the other a old Land Rover Forward Control .\nAny way this Landrover is like an Unimog , it is BIG and slow , but has loads of character and is strong .\nOn the way up , just before the Zimbabwe border , the head-gasket of the Hilux blew , so 9 of us and all our bigwall gear and equipment , squashed into the Landrover for a very slow drive through Zimbabwe , Tete corridor , Malawi and then into Mozambique .\n5 days of traveling we finally arrived at Lalaua , the village near Sitting Chief .\nAbout a hour later and to everyone s amazement Pieter arrived in the Hilux .\nHe had stayed behind in Masina to get the head gasket fixed and then drove 2500 km on his own to catch up with us .\nThe Administrator in Lalaua would not give us permission to climb the dome as the area contained valuable minerals according to a Dutch company who had done a survey , and now no one was allow to enter the area around the dome .\nSo we drove 3 hours on bad roads to the capital city of the north , Nampula to speak to the Governor , who then gave us permission to climb .\nThe climbing looked like it would be interesting from a distance as the face contained huge huecos big holes in the rock , shallow caves .\nWe split up into 4 climbing parties to attempt different lines .\nIt turned out that a couple of pitches up , the rock became covered in thick lichen which made for unpleasant climbing .\nThe attempts were aborted at various levels up the rockface .\nNext we focused our energies on reaching the summit via a huge corner system , this provided for some interesting climbing up corners and chimneys at about grade 23 .\nPeter Robins , Dave Turnbull and Pieter Martin were first on the summit followed by Leo Holding , Mark Seuring and Alard H fner .\nBen Bransby and Andrew Donson got within one pitch of the summit the day before but turned back as it was getting late .\nMatthew Munting and Izak Steyn retreated off their route .\nWe then headed off to Mlema 3 to do some real climbing on African Light , the route that Mark and I opened in 2000 , BUT it rained .\nRain in the middle of winter !!!\nDave , Ben and Andy spent a miserable night bivying in the rain at the base of the climb .\nThey had planned to bivi on Bundu ledge but the rain caught them 3 pitches up , and it was getting dark so they abseiled down and sat out the night in the rain ... with spirits dampened and the weather looking grim we headed off to lake Malawi .\nHere we relaxed in the sun and did some kayaking with Kayak Africa .\nA further 3 days of traveling , by now we were so accustomed to this we arrived at Blyde River Canyon , where we opened some amazing climbs .\nThis was definitely the climbing highlight of the trip .\nA couple of climbs at 26 were opened onsight .\nTwo days at the Restaurant clipping bolts and it was time for the Brits to leave South Africa .\nWe all had a great time and got on very well .\nOur slack lining has drastically improved .\nA huge THANK YOU to the Mountain Club of South Africa , Upat , Fuji film , Scavenger , Rock-on-climbing and World Expedition.org for assisting the expedition through sponsorship .\nTHE SHIELD ROPE SOLOED BY ALARD HUFNER By Alard H fner - November 1999 My Friends and I were sitting in the Yosemite meadows , looking up at climbers on El Cap , when we spotted someone on this blank headwall .\nThat had to be the Shield , it looked so exposed .\nWe were amazed that a climb even went up this piece of rock .\nDuring the next couple of weeks I spoke to people who had done the route and they all said that it was a real fun route with lots of open space and exposure .\nWhen Mike , Marianne and Dermot had left the Valley , I needed something to climb and so the idea to solo the Shield popped into my head .\nI had never soloed a big wall before and only practiced rope soloing on two other occasions .\nWhen I was learning to rope solo , I had rope soloed the first ten pitches to Mammoth Ledges same first ten pitches as Free Blast and Salethe , from where there are fixed lines all the way down to the ground .\nWhen I was ready for the route , I jugged up those lines with all my requirements for 5 days .\nI managed two pitches higher than the fixed ropes and as it was getting dark I set up the porta ledge and was comfy asleep , when it started raining .\nSo in the dark and rain I had to re-setup the porta ledge with the fly , which was brand new and had not been seam sealed .\nIt kept raining until about 8 in the morning .\nThe wind was blowing the whole ledge around .\nI was not far from this little gully , which the rain turned into a river .\nThis all made for an unpleasant adventure .\nMost of the things got fairly wet during the night and as I had lost my enthusiasm to continue , retreat was still possible as I was not to high , so I fixed some lines and abseiled all the way down to the ground , leaving the gear at my high point .\nSpent the weekend re-motivating in San Francisco and had loads of fun , as it was Halloween .\nMonday , I jugged back up the lines , climbed some more pitches and set up the ledge below a big roof .\nThere were three American climbers on a route called Albatross , which runs parallel to the Shield and only about thirty to forty meters to the left .\nTherefore I had some company as we shouted across to each other every now and then .\nIn the morning I lead the roof pitch , which brought me straight onto the headwall .\nThe exposure started to kick in . . in a big way .\nThe Shield headwall starts about 500m up , is blank , slightly bulging , slightly overhanging and smooth except for a thin crack\\/seam running up it .\nIn many places copper heads and rurps baby pitons are the only things that will fit .\nThere were a lot of fixed copper heads so I did not have to place any which was good because I only had two copperheads anyway .\nI did not clip the copperheads because in the event of a fall they would probably be ripped out , and I would be unable to put in more .\nThis caused me to lead out several times .\nThis was the case when I was nearing the bolts , but I could just not reach them .\nThere was some sling tape around the bolt so I clipped my aiders into that and stood in them .\nI was about to clip into the bolt direct when I heard this frightening tear and the next sensation was falling through the air upside down .\nIt was amazing how fast I thought about the last placement I had clipped ; if it would hold ; how far was I going to fall .\nThank goodness this old fixed aluminum piton held and I came to an upside down halt about eight meters lower than I was a few seconds earlier .\nThank goodness this rope soloing technique works !!!!!!\nI managed to get back up to the bolts making sure I clipped the bolts this time and then set up camp .\nTo the left and right and up and down there was just blank rock with only this three or four millimeter wide crack\\/seam leading the way .\nThree pitches a day is about the going rate for A3 or harder when soloing , and that s what I was managing on the headwall .\nGoing to the toilet can be an interesting affair .\nThe rules are , climbers must carry a porta potty .\nSo , one has to do one s business into a brown paper bag and then put this into the porta potty , which can be a bucket with a lid or a large PVC pipe with lids .\nAiming into the paper bag is vital when on a porta ledge , as soiling the ledge would not be fun , as this is the kitchen , the bed and the bathroom .\nI managed to take another two falls higher up on the head wall when gear popped .\nThe one fall was about ten meters and as I was falling it was ripping out lots of the gear I had placed .\nWhen I finally came to a halt , all the popped gear slid down the rope towards me , in this instance about 6 pieces of gear .\nI then went back up , hammering in those pitons , which I had been slightly reluctant to do , as getting pitons out is more work .\nAbove the head wall , ledges start appearing which makes biving\\/sleeping much easier .\nThe penultimate pitch is a big fun roof and the last pitch a chimney .\nThe only problem I had was on the last haul when I was hauling the last two pitches in one .\nThe fifi hook would not release from the bolt , so I had to abseil back down over the roof .\nhanging in mid air a 1000m up , then pull myself back into the stance to release the bag and then jumar back up .\nA couple of meters of grade four scrambling and I was at the TOP !!!!\n. . time for a beer .\nAhhhh after seven days climbing it felt great to be at the top !\nThe hike down was absolutely terrible having to carry all that equipment .\nThe route was opened in 1972 .\nThe speed record for the Shield from bottom to top is an incredible ten hours fifty eight minutes .\nTwo days later I left the valley for the last time on this trip , as rain and the first snow fell .\nExtreme Thanks go to Hans Florine , Abby Watkins , Dan Dunkal , Craig Calonica and Dan Mc Divett , who let me use and abuse their gear .\nTHE NOSE IN A DAY By Alard H fner 1999 Every time I look up at El Cap in Yosemite Valley I think to myself ; that is one huge piece of rock .\nMarianne Pretorius and I climbed the Nose together in August .\nIt took us four days .\nMike Mason and Dermot Brogan started ahead of us and it took them 5 days .\nWhen one is on a big wall for four days one has to haul a lot of items up , water , food , sleeping bags etc. .\nand thus the haul bag can weigh over 40 kg .\nThis slows one s climbing down considerably because the haulbag needs to get pulled up at every stance .\nWhen Hans said to me that he had a free day to go climbing , I hinted that I was keen to climb the Nose and thus we made plans to climb it in a day .\nAs Hans had climbed the route 31 times before he holds the record for most Nose ascents , he knew the exact rack of gear needed .\nThe rack consisted of double caming devices from 00 to two inch and one each of three and four inch .\nA couple of quick draws and six nuts were taken , mainly micro nuts .\nOne 60 m rope , two ascenders and some aiders .\n4 liters of water , some Power bars and peanuts .\nWe awoke at 05h00am , had breakfast and set off .\nWe started the climb at 06h50am .\nAs I did not enjoy the first couple of pitches on my earlier ascent , Hans led to Sickle Ledge .\nI took the lead from there , and led up the Stovelegs these pitches were named by Warren Harding who opened the route in 1958 when he used pitons made from the legs of an old stove as protection .\nHans simul-climbed below me .\nWe passed one party of two climbers who happily let us by .\nHans lead the last pitch up to Dolt Tower with me jugging on the line he fixed .\nIt is quicker if the leader gets to a stance , fixes the rope and the seconder juggs up and cleans the pitch .\nWe reached Dolt Tower in just over two hours which , on the previous trip had taken us 2 days .\nI led on towards El Cap Tower .\nAs I had been up the Texas Flake and the Bootleg Flake with Marianne , we decided on doing the Jardine Traverse , a slight variation to the route .\nThree more pitches and we were at camp four , the half way mark on the route .\nWe sat for a couple of minutes , ate some food , drank some water , and enjoyed the amazing view ... it was so cool !\nHans led the pitch up to the Great Roof , then I led the Great Roof which took me 28 minutes to lead and 7 minutes for Hans to clean it , thus taking 35 min for that pitch .\nI was leading using Hans super light aiders and whilst stepping up on a piece of gear , one of the straps on the aiders snapped , letting me drop about 20 cm before it caught me again , thus sending some adrenaline through my system .\nThis pitch has only been free climbed by Lynn Hill and Scott Burke .\nIT LOOKS AMAZINGLY SUPER DIFFICULT !!!!!\nI free climbed the next pitch called the Pancake Flake which has its name due to it being a thin flake that forms a super lay back .\nFree climbing this pitch at about grade 19\\/20 is super because one is about 500m up and there is great exposure .\nWe alternated leads most of the way to the top , passing a team of four Italians on the second last \\/ last pitch .\nWe reached the top nine hours and twenty two minutes after we had started .\nBrilliant !!!!\nThis was my third time up El Cap and Hans sixty sixth time .\nThe walk down took 1 hour and 10 minutes .\nIt felt very good just to be able to sit in the car .\nThis is a super route , with excellent cracks in clean solid granite .\nHighly recommended !!!\nI was very fortunate to be able to climb this route with Hans Florine .\nBack to Top \\* Back to Home Page Copyright 2003 SACIN Send news , corrections , new routes , adverts etc. .\nto news@saclimb.co.za Please

'Back to Homepage Yosemite The Nose in a day By Alard H fner 1999 Every time I looked up at El Cap in Yosemite Valley I thought to myself ; that is one huge piece of rock .\nMarianne Pretorius and I climbed the Nose together in August .\nIt took us four days .\nMike Mason and Dermot Brogan started ahead of us and it took them 5 days .\nWhen one is on a big wall for four days one has to haul a lot of items up , water , food , sleeping bags etc. .\nand thus the haul bag can weigh over 40 kg .\nThis slows one s climbing down considerably because the haulbag needs to get pulled up at every stance .\nWhen Hans said to me that he had a free day to go climbing , I hinted that I was keen to climb the Nose and thus we made plans to climb it in a day .\nAs Hans had climbed the route 31 times before he holds the record for most Nose ascents , he knew the exact rack of gear needed .\nThe rack consisted of double caming devices from 00 to two inch and one each of three and four inch .\nA couple of quick draws and six nuts were taken , mainly micro nuts .\nOne 60 m rope , two ascenders and some aiders .\n4 liters of water , some Power bars and peanuts .\nWe awoke at 05h00am , had breakfast and set off .\nWe started the climb at 06h50am .\nAs I did not enjoy the first couple of pitches on my earlier ascent , Hans led to Sickle Ledge .\nI took the lead from there , and led up the Stovelegs these pitches were named by Warren Harding who opened the route in 1958 when he used pitons made from the legs of an old stove as protection .\nHans simul-climbed below me .\nWe passed one party of two climbers who happily let us by .\nHans lead the last Stovelegs pitch up to Dolt Tower with me jugging on the line he fixed .\nIt is quicker if the leader gets to a stance , fixes the rope and the seconder juggs up and cleans the pitch .\nWe reached Dolt Tower in just over two hours which , on the previous trip had taken us 2 days .\nHans and Alard I led on towards El Cap Tower .\nAs I had been up the Texas Flake and the Bootleg Flake with Marianne , we decided on doing the Jardine Traverse , a slight variation to the route .\nThree more pitches and we were at camp four , the half way mark on the route .\nWe sat for a couple of minutes , ate some food , drank some water , and enjoyed the amazing view ... it was so cool !\nHans led the pitch up to the Great Roof , then I led the Great Roof which took me 28 minutes to lead and 7 minutes for Hans to clean it , thus taking 35 min for that pitch .\nI was leading using Hans super light aiders and whilst stepping up on a piece of gear , one of the straps on the aiders snapped , letting me drop about 20 cm before it caught me again , thus sending some adrenaline through my system .\nThis pitch has only been free climbed by Lynn Hill and Scott Burke .\nIT LOOKS AMAZINGLY SUPER DIFFICULT !!!!!\nI free climbed the next pitch called the Pancake Flake which has its name due to it being a thin flake that forms a super lay back crack .\nFree climbing this pitch at about grade 19\\/20 is exhilarating because one is about 500m up and there is great exposure .\nWe alternated leads most of the way to the top , passing a team of four Italians on the second last \\/ last pitch .\nWe reached the top nine hours and twenty two minutes after we had started .\nBrilliant !!!!\nThis was my third time up El Cap and Hans sixty sixth time .\nThe walk down took 1 hour and 10 minutes .\nIt felt very good just to be able to sit in the car .\nThis is a super route , with excellent cracks in clean solid granite .\nHighly recommended !!!\nI was very fortunate to be able to climb this route with Hans Florine .\nFor more info on Hans have a look at his webpage www.speedclimb.com El Cap in Yosemite , with the approximate line of the Nose in blue History A typical ascent of the Nose , which takes the average speed climber between 12 and 15 hours .\nThe first ascent of the Nose , in 1957 and 58 Warren Harding , a bon vivant from Northern California , spent 45 days over 18 months literally carving his route by drilling some 200 expansion bolts into the sheer granite face , infuriating environmentalists but fascinating just about everyone else .\nThrough newspapers and radio the entire nation followed intently as Harding and his team of two other climbers established four campsites on ledges along the way , all of the sites linked by 1,200 feet of rope secured by nearly 700 pitons .\nHundreds of pounds of supplies were winched up by a clumsy device called the Dolt Cart -- a pull cart with two bicycle wheels .\nThe circuslike sight caused traffic jams on the main road below , which at one point prompted a ranger to yell at Harding through a bullhorn , Get your ass down from there !\nIn October 1958 a ranger demanded that Harding complete the climb by Thanksgiving or abandon it .\nFinally , on Nov. 12 , after a continuous 12-day push , Harding staggered over the rim of the Nose .\nIt was not at all clear to me who was the conqueror and who was conquered , Harding would say a year later .\nI do recall that El Cap seemed to be in much better condition than I was .\nSo began the popularity of big-wall climbing in the U. S. , with Yosemite as the sport s epicenter and Harding as the free-spirited forefather .\nIn late February , Harding died of liver failure at age 77 , and as night fell on the Yosemite Valley on May 25 , some 400 climbers gathered in a granite quarry behind an abandoned gas station in Bishop , Calif. , to celebrate his life .\nThe diverse group included erstwhile rock stars such as Royal Robbins and Yvon Chouinard , aging Vulgarians -- members of the famously hedonistic sect of climbers who have been part of the Yosemite scene since the 60s -- and big-wall vagabonds who had hitched hundreds of miles .\nSome recalled Harding s infamous drinking binges while others told salacious tales of his womanizing .\nAt the end of each of his first ascents , for example , a bottle of champagne and a beautiful woman who had been ferried up a much simpler route would be waiting .\nThough his skills didn t match those of his contemporaries Robbins and Chouinard , Harding didn t care to work hard enough to improve .\nScrewing is more enjoyable than drilling bolt holes , he liked to say .\nNevertheless , says veteran Yosemite climber Mike Corbett , People were just drawn to him , and no one s been able to match him .\nHe was so full of life .\nSo , too , was the Yosemite Valley .\nWhile beachboys on longboards were proliferating along the Southern California coast in the early 60s , Harding s antiestablishment band of climbers -- including boozers , dopers and drifters -- was making merry some 280 miles to the northeast .\nAfter descending upon Camp 4 , the venerated four-acre dirt patch just east of El Cap , the climbers provoked park rangers by mooning tourists and stealing campers food .\nThey held raucous parties long past midnight .\nThey were incorrigibly loud , except when authorities asked them about matters like the whereabouts of 240 40-pound bales of pot that disappeared from a smuggler s plane that crashed in the Valley in February 1977 .\nFor all their hedonism , these wall rats were also supremely gifted athletes and left no rock unscaled in the valley .\nBy the early 1970s every meaningful big-wall route in Yosemite had been established , and climbers turned to setting speed records .\nBy the mid - 70s advances in climbing technique and gear had enabled climbers to reach the peak of the Nose in less than 24 hours .\nDuring an unprecedented 15-hour climb in 1975 , Jim Bridwell , John Long and Billy Westbay ditched their haul bags and carried a mere 11 2 gallons of water -- not to mention two packs of Camel straights , which they lit up while on each of the route s 34 pitches .\nWe thought we were so studly , Bridwell says .\nWe didn t think about trying to set another record , because the whole point was just to break 24 hours .\nThese guys are a new breed .\nWhat they re doing is phenomenal .\nThe first of this new breed , which arrived in the Yosemite Valley in the early 1980s , included Peter Croft and Dave Schultz , speed-climbing pioneers who employed riskier techniques such as simul-climbing , in which two roped-up climbers ascend together .\nCroft and Schultz , soon joined by Florine , turned the Nose into the autobahn , completing ascents in nine hours and 15 minutes , then 8 02 , then 6 40 .\nWhen Croft and a partner went sub-five in 1991 , Florine inquired about teaming with him to try to set a new record .\nCroft agreed , and in June 1992 the duo took the wall in 4 22 .\nEveryone thought what they did was mind-blowing , O Neill says .\nI thought that record would never be broken .\nBack to top Back to Homepage THE SHIELD ROPE SOLOED BY ALARD HUFNER By Alard H fner - November 1999 My Friends and I were sitting in the Yosemite meadows , looking up at climbers on El Cap , when we spotted someone on this blank headwall .\nThat had to be the Shield , it looked so exposed .\nWe were amazed that a climb even went up this piece of rock .\nDuring the next couple of weeks I spoke to people who had done the route and they all said that it was a real fun route with lots of open space and exposure .\nWhen Mike , Marianne and Dermot had left the Valley , I needed something to climb and so the idea to solo the Shield popped into my head .\nI had never soloed a big wall before and only practiced rope soloing on two other occasions .\nWhen I was learning to rope solo , I had practiced on the first ten pitches of the Shield to Mammoth Ledges same first ten pitches as Free Blast and Salethe .\nFrom here there are fixed lines all the way down to the ground .\nWhen I was ready for the route , I jugged up those lines with all my requirements for 5 days .\nI managed two pitches higher than the fixed ropes and as it was getting dark I set up the porta ledge and was comfy asleep , when it started raining .\nSo in the dark and rain I had to re-setup the porta ledge with the fly , which was brand new and had not been seam sealed .\nIt kept raining until about 8 in the morning .\nThe wind was blowing the whole ledge around .\nI was not far from this little gully , which the rain turned into a river .\nThis all made for an unpleasant adventure .\nMost of the things got fairly wet during the night and as I had lost my enthusiasm to continue , retreat was still possible as I was not to high , so I fixed some lines and abseiled all the way down to the ground , leaving the gear at my high point .\nSpent the weekend re-motivating in San Francisco and had loads of fun , as it was Halloween .\nThe flight of the Albatross Monday , I jugged back up the lines , climbed some more pitches and set up the ledge below a big roof .\nThere were three American climbers on a route called Flight of the Albatross , which runs parallel to the Shield and only about thirty to forty meters to the left .\nTherefore I had some company as we shouted across to each other every now and then .\nIn the morning I lead the roof pitch , which brought me straight onto the headwall .\nThe exposure started to kick in . . in a big way .\nThe Shield headwall starts about 500m up , is blank , slightly bulging , slightly overhanging and smooth except for a thin crack\\/seam running up it .\nIn many places copper heads and rurps baby pitons are the only things that will fit .\nThere were a lot of fixed copper heads so I did not have to place any which was good because I only had two spare copperheads anyway .\nI did not clip the copperheads because in the event of a fall they would probably be ripped out , and I would be unable to put in more .\nThis caused me to lead out several times .\nThis was the case when I was nearing the bolts , but I could just not reach them .\nThere was some old sling tape around the bolt so I clipped my aiders into that and stood in them .\nI was about to clip into the bolt direct when I heard this frightening tear and the next sensation was falling through the air upside down .\nIt was amazing how fast I thought about the last placement I had clipped ; if it would hold ; how far was I going to fall .\nThank goodness this old fixed aluminum piton held and I came to an upside down halt about eight meters lower than I was a few seconds earlier .\nThank goodness this rope soloing technique works !!!!!!\nI managed to get back up to the bolts making sure I clipped the bolts this time and then set up camp .\nTo the left and right and up and down there was just blank rock with only this three or four millimetre wide crack\\/seam leading the way .\nThree pitches a day is about the going rate for A3 or harder when soloing , and that s what I was managing on the headwall .\nGoing to the toilet can be an interesting affair .\nThe rules are , climbers must carry a porta potty .\nSo , one has to do one s business into a brown paper bag and then put this into the porta potty , which can be a bucket with a lid or a large PVC pipe with lids .\nAiming into the paper bag is vital when on a porta ledge , as soiling the ledge would not be fun , as this is the kitchen , the bed and the bathroom .\nI managed to take another two falls higher up on the head wall when gear popped .\nThe one fall was about ten meters and as I was falling it was ripping out lots of the gear I had placed .\nWhen I finally came to a halt , all the popped gear slid down the rope towards me , in this instance about 6 pieces of gear .\nI then went back up , hammering in those pitons , which I had been slightly reluctant to do , as getting pitons out is more work .\nAbove the head wall , ledges start appearing which makes biving\\/sleeping much easier .\nThe penultimate pitch is a big fun roof and the last pitch a chimney .\nThe only problem I had was on the last pitch when I was hauling the last two pitches in one .\nThe fifi hook which was holding the haulbag in place would not release from the bolt , so I had to abseil back down over the roof .\nhanging in mid air a 1000m up , then pull myself back into the stance to release the bag to then jumar back up .\nA couple of meters of grade four scrambling and I was at the TOP !!!!\n. . time for a beer .\nAhhhh after seven days climbing it felt great to be at the top !\nThe hike down was absolutely terrible having to carry all that equipment .\nThe route was opened in 1972 .\nThe speed record for the Shield from bottom to top is an incredible ten hours fifty-eight minutes .\nTwo days

Tex , red Gore - Tex , top and her green pack and we drove over to the Canadian Tire on Richmond Road , he said .\nI got to tell you that my wife , when we left our house , she stood at the doorway to the garage and was very concerned and was tearing up because of just concerns about safety , he said .\nMarissa gave me a big hug and nestled her head against my neck and said , Dad , I love you .\nAnd I said Marissa , I love you too .\nAnd I said , have a great trip .\nAnd that was the last time I saw her alive .\nThe skiers went to British Columbia s Glacier National Park , one of the most popular places in the world for backcountry adventure .\nEnthusiasts can trek up trails into the steep mountains and bowls of untouched snow .\nIt s a skier s paradise .\nIt s also avalanche country .\nThe students and their teachers knew that and trained for it .\nWhat they didn t know was that they were about to ski into the worst-case scenario .\nMarissa gave me a big hug and nestled her head against my neck and said , Dad , I love you .\nRick Marshall Saturday morning was day two of the trip , and the group headed up a popular trail into a mountain valley .\nThere were a number of other skiers in the area that day .\nRick Marshall was one of them .\nI think it was probably around 10 30 or something like that when we left the car and headed up the Connaught Creek drainage , he said .\nAnd we were , you know , there s a few people ahead of us , we realized on the trail and , you know , we started passing a few groups and some groups were going off into another drainage to ski and they came across the school group and passed them , he said .\nWe just started off from our break .\nWe noticed an avalanche coming down off the north face of Mount Cheops and that s when we realized that there was , you know , a good group of skiers was below , in the path of it , he said .\nWe actually yelled to them that there was an avalanche coming down off of Cheops , said Marshall .\nWe actually witnessed the avalanche hit a couple of the front members of the group .\nAbby Watkins Abby Watkins also saw the avalanche .\nWithin seconds , I had the realization that it was going to be very big , she said .\nI had a question as to whether we were safe because we were straight across from it .\nAnd then we just braced for what was going to happen .\nAnd then we were hit by the powder cloud , said Watkins .\nRight off the bat , I could see that there were people caught in it , said Marshall .\nAnd then , you know , I saw a hand sticking out and , you know , a leg further over and somebody partially buried .\nThere was little chance that I could save everybody , said Watkins .\nYou just have to save as many people as possible .\nThere was little chance that I could save everybody , said Watkins .\nYou just have to save as many people as possible .\nWithin an hour , seven helicopters , 48 people and three search dogs were on the scene .\nBut Rick Marshall got there first .\nI went to the person with the hand sticking out , he said .\nThat just happened to be Andrew , the group leader and he had a cellphone on him - not a cellphone but a satellite phone - and so we radioed Parks personnel .\nEric Dafoe Eric Dafoe was avalanche rescue commander that day .\nI got the call from dispatch in Rogers Pass and said you re going to work , he said .\nMy initial reaction was , this is really serious , and we ve got to act quickly .\nDafoe met Jordy Shepherd , an avalanche site rescue leader , and they flew to the scene by helicopter .\nThis was our worst-case scenario , said Shepherd .\nA large natural avalanche in a busy area that hit a large group .\nThat type of dry slab avalanche can generally reach speeds of 150 to 200 kilometres an hour and it actually pushes a pillow of wind in front of it .\nSylvain Hebert Sylvain Hebert , a heli-ski guide and rescuer , was skiing nearby at the time of the avalanche .\nI had just been dropped off on top of a run and I d skied maybe 20 turns and I got a call on the radio from our radio dispatch telling me that there was an avalanche at Rogers Pass and that they needed our help , he said .\nI just grabbed the shovel and shovelled as well .\nJordy Shepherd Shepherd and Dafoe credit a number of guides , including Hebert , Marshall and Watkins with rescuing several of the victims .\nWatkins and Marshall were probably responsible for saving five people s lives , said Dafoe .\nMarshall said he had no choice but to act quickly .\nA slide that powerful and with that kind of snow density , you know , you only have five , 10 minutes , he said .\nThere were no air pockets in the snow .\nYou re just holding your breath .\nMarshall said some victims were conscious , and some were not .\nIn a situation like that , you just , you give er and you don t stop , he said .\nYou re on adrenalin and , you know , you dig hard and you search hard and you just try and get the job done as fast as you can .\nWatkins said it was difficult to deal with the fact that some of the teens weren t alive when they got to them .\nEvery face I saw like that , I realized that there was a family attached , that this was going to devastate that family , she said .\nAs the rescue progressed , the winds picked up and conditions turned dangerous .\nMarshall said he and the other rescuers worried another avalanche would hit them .\nWe were a little concerned , you know , why this avalanche started , he said .\nThe winds were a little higher now and we were concerned for our own safety as well .\nThe rescuers beat an orderly retreat .\nOur world had stopped .\nDonna Broshko remembered how she heard about the avalanche .\nI m going out the back way , out the garage door , and the phone rings and it s the headmaster from school , and he said , Donna , there s been an accident .\nI said OK , well , is everybody okay ?\nAnd he says , Oh no , unfortunately not .\nI say , well what do you mean unfortunately not ?\nOr something like that .\nAnd he said , Well , there s been some fatalities .\nAnd he says Oh , there s been such a tragedy .\nAnd I was like , cut to the chase .\nLike I ve had enough waiting .\nLike I just , no more peripheral stuff , like just tell me how Scott is .\nHe says I m really sorry , he s one of the victims .\nWell , that was like , it was like phenomenal .\nIt was like , like just such disbelief .\nJust no , no. .\nJust no. .\nJust no. .\nKarl Staddon Karl Staddon also got the call .\nI asked for the RCMP s number in Revelstoke , which he provided to me , he said .\nAnd so I called and I spoke with Officer Sommerville who also was very gracious .\nAnd he , I told him who I was .\nI was the father of one of the students involved in the trip - I understand there s been an avalanche and wondered if he could fill me in .\nAnd then he paused and he said , you should brace yourself for the worst possible outcome .\nAnd my heart about leapt out of my chest .\nAnd then he went on to say , and again with great compassion and care , he said that there are nine students that are accounted for , or alive and accounted for .\nYour daughter is not on that list .\nBut we can not say with 100 per cent certainty that she s deceased at this stage , he said .\nWe were numbed , to be honest , said Staddon .\nTruly numbed .\nJust could not believe it .\nOur world had stopped .\nJanice Pinkerton As the families struggled to cope with the tragedy , Revelstoke resident Janice Pinkerton a member of Revelstoke Victims Services opened her home to the survivors .\nA lot of them had bangs in their faces and their ears and they didn t look like they had been , they were wounded , but they were definitely hurt , she said .\nAnd they talked about hotels and that , and that didn t strike me , that struck me wrong .\nSo I said that I had a house that was more than big enough and I m sure I could find enough blankets and sleeping bags and beds and they could sleep there , she said .\nThe memory I ll have is their faces , their ears , because they had , a lot of them had like swollen faces , she said .\nAnd how they huddled .\nHow they were always together .\nAnd they , it was almost like they moved as a group and I thought that that was , that was very powerful to me , that they were so , so focused on each other , she said .\nIn Calgary , normal life stopped .\nSeven funerals in less than a week .\nThe city ran out of flowers .\nDonna Broshko At her son Scott s funeral , Donna Broshko carried his ashes in an urn .\nI thought I m his mother .\nI carried him for nine months .\nI can carry him out .\nI can do this , you know .\nAnd I did it .\nI just , I can do this , right ?\nIt s something you can do for your child , right ?\nKarl Staddon reflected on the funeral for his daughter Marissa .\nWhen I wrote the funeral card , I looked at some of the other cards and you know , people live to be 75 or 85 , and 15 years seemed so incredibly short , he said .\nAnd I did the math and Marissa was with us for 5,712 days .\nThat sounded better .\nAnd they were glorious days .\nStrathcona - Tweedsmuir School launched an investigation into the tragic school trip , and it is reviewing its outdoor education program that is the cornerstone of the private school s philosophy .\nIn the meantime , all other school trips are canceled .\nDonna Broshko says she doesn t blame the school for her son s death .\nIn my heart , I believe that they did do everything that they could do , you know .\nSometimes things happen in life , right ?\nSometimes things happen in life , right ?\nStaddon agrees .\nI m at peace with the decision-making by the trip leaders that particular day , he said .\nAnd I m satisfied that this is a very rare occurrence of this magnitude that involved a school group .\nJordy Shepherd said that the group did everything right .\nThis group was , they were very well prepared and , and it was an unfortunate circumstance that they were , they were there at that time , he said .\nBut the four seconds that wiped out seven young lives will leave lasting scars , not just on the school and the families , but also on the people who fought to save the skiers , and the B.

C. avalanche in a month REVELSTOKE , B. C. CP - Seven teens on a high-school ski excursion in the back country of east-central B. C. died Saturday when a half-kilometre-wide avalanche came down from above them and engulfed their group .\nIt was the second deadly slide to hit the region in as many weeks .\nSeven adults perished in a slide in January .\nThe dead were six boys and one girl , all in Grade 10 at Strathcona - Tweedsmuir School , a private day school on an expansive rural campus in the foothills southwest of Calgary .\nWe are absolutely stricken with grief .\nOur hearts go out to all those who are impacted , Tony Macoun , head of the school , said in a written statement .\nFrantic parents gathered at the school Saturday night , arriving separately and in groups , embracing each other .\nNo students were visible .\nOur school is a small family and loss this extreme is impacting us tremendously , said Macoun .\nThere were 17 people in the school group , three adults and 14 Grade 10 students in an outdoor education class , on their annual cross-country ski trip .\nThe avalanche occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon , said Pam Doyle , superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke .\nIt happened on the north face of the mountain in Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley , about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit .\nThe group was led by two male teachers and a male volunteer .\nAll had certification and back-country experience , Macoun said .\nThe group had been skiing about 15 metres apart , with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear .\nThe skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope , burying nearly the entire group .\nAnother group of young skiers witnessed the avalanche and were among the first to help .\nA supervisor whose hand was just visible above the snow was the first to be dug out .\nOnce freed , he called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm .\nOf the remaining students , six of the students are safe and one has a broken ankle , Macoun said in his statement .\nThe three leaders were uninjured and are attending to the survivors , who were in Revelstoke on Saturday night after being airlifted first to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter .\nTwo people from the group were treated for minor injuries , said RCMP Sgt.\nRandy Brown .\nThe avalanche was very powerful , with a rating from 3 to 3.5 , compared with a top rating of 4 , said Pat Dunn , a Parks Canada spokeswoman .\nThe size 3 to 3.5 avalanche could destroy a building .\n.\n.\nor 10 acres of forest , she said .\nThe slide was 500 to 800 metres wide and traveled a kilometre down the slope .\nSome of the skiers were buried as deep as three metres , said Dunn .\nShe said the group was carrying the proper avalanche-rescue equipment , including personal locator beacons and digging tools .\nA park conditions bulletin said there was a considerable avalanche hazard in the area Saturday .\nThat rating is about the middle of the hazard scale but includes the high probability that a person could trigger a slide , said Dunn .\nThe risk always varies .\n.\n.\nwhen the risk is posted as considerable it s a note to skiers to be cautious , she said .\nThere are a couple of instabilities in our snow pack this winter .\n.\n. that may have contributed and further investigation will determine that .\nSaturday s slide was unusually deadly , said Eric Dafoe , public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke .\nWe ve never had an avalanche like this where we had a multiple number of people buried , said Dafoe , who worked on the rescue effort and flew over the slide as part the initial investigation .\nIt was a huge slide , he said .\nIt covered the valley floor from side to side .\nDafoe said the slide began at a point between 2,200 to 2,300 vertical metres up Mount Cheops .\nIt traveled for a kilometre and spread out half a kilometre at the sides .\nThe toe of the slide ended at about the 1,500-metre elevation mark with parts of it more than five metres deep .\nDafoe said the investigation will continue but was almost certain it was a natural slide .\nIt the slide trigger site is so far from the bottom it seems unlikely it was human-triggered , he said .\nDafoe speculated a small slide may have occurred high up the mountain and as it came down , it dragged out snow from surrounding gullies .\nPark wardens , RCMP officers and local ski tour operators and guides , backed up by four or five helicopters and search dogs , joined in the rescue effort .\nMembers of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche-control work were also on hand to assist .\nRuedi Beglinger , owner of Selkirk Mountain Experience and organizer of the fatal expedition last month , was with his clients when it struck .\nContacted Saturday night , Beglinger did not want to comment on the level of experience necessary to ski the area where the students were caught .\nThere is an inherent risk in back-country skiing which is very important to talk about , an inherent risk people have to be willing to share amongst themselves whether they have a guide or not , he said .\nThe area of Saturday s slide is not particularly remote , but Dunn said there were no groomed trails , except people who have been there before you .\nBut no guides are needed to ski in the area and skiers do not have to register before setting off .\nIt s a very , very popular ski destination site , said Dunn , media liaison officer at the national park .\nBrown said the skiers were not part of a commercial tour group .\nDoyle said that at this time there are no plans yet to close back-country areas of the park .\nOfficial Reports Avalanche Tragedy in Glacier National Park by Doreen Mc Gillis , Parks Canada Published in the Avalanche News of the Canadian Avalanche Association On February 1 , 2003 , a huge avalanche swept into the Connaught Creek drainage of Glacier National Park and into the awareness of millions of Canadians .\nThis avalanche accident attracted the attention of the nation .\nThe seven victims of this avalanche were 15-year olds on a school field trip , and the accident happened less than two weeks after an avalanche that killed seven skiers in an area only 40 kilometres away .\nAll 17 skiers in the school group were caught in this avalanche , either partially or fully buried , and 10 survived .\nTwo Association of Canadian Mountain Guides ACMG members were above this party , heard and saw the avalanche across the valley and tried to warn the group , but the avalanche hit them so fast they were unable to get to safety .\nThe rescuers , Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall , immediately skied down to the slide area and started to dig out those buried .\nThe first person that they dug out called for help on his satellite phone , which mobilized a large rescue team .\nThen , as members of the group were freed from the slide , they helped dig out the others .\nUpon hearing the number of people who were caught in this avalanche , the rescuers wondered how so many could be involved .\nTheir answer came when they flew to the scene of the avalanche It was huge .\nThe fracture zone was about 800 metres wide and the run ? out was more than a kilometre long .\nThe size of the rescue operation was also huge more than 30 people , seven helicopters , six avalanche dogs and their handlers and dozens of support staff were involved .\nThis was a multi-agency rescue , involving Parks Canada staff from three national parks , several local companies Selkirk Tangiers Helicopter Skiing , Canadian Mountain Holidays , Selkirk Mountain Experience , Alpine Helicopters , Kokanee Helicopters , Shell Canada Revelstoke , Executive Flight Services , mountain guides , RCMP , tourists , medical staff and the Canadian Army stationed at Rogers Pass .\nImportant services provided during the rescue included grief counseling , support to the families , media relations , transportation and logistical support .\nParticipating in such a difficult situation is very stressful .\nIt is tragic that seven young people lost their lives in the accident , and the people of Revelstoke and Golden have shared this grief .\nThe speedy rescue helped save the lives of the remaining 10 people in the group , and to quickly recover the victims .\nThe credit for the speed and efficiency of the entire rescue effort can be shared among all of those who participated in this rescue .\nTimes such as these show how public safety professionals and volunteers truly rise to the occasion when called upon .\nThe staff and management of Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks would like to offer our gratitude and appreciation to all of the individuals who took part in the rescue efforts following the tragic avalanche of February 1 , 2003 .\nSteve Blagbrough Anders Blakstvedt Evelyn Enn Kyle Hale Scott Hicks Clair Israelson Shelly Jackson Peter Kimmel Rich Marshall Carolyn Mc Bain Kathleen O Toole

'preview previewathletes previewathletes tv schedule Speed Leapfroggin the Wall Wednesday , June 24 Second place finisher Aaron Shamy doesn t need his feet to jump up the wall .\nElena Ovchinnikova takes em down 1-2-3 to take her 3rd X Games Gold in speedclimbing .\nAudio , photos and hidden clues , oh yeah ... And there are blushing Marines .\nDifficulty It s All about Brown Core Updated Tuesday , June 23 Katie Brown retains her status as the best female sport climber in the world .\nShe gracefully contemplated every move with slow , lizard-like precision and pulled her slender 85 pound frame to the top of the X Games podium for the third time .\nChristian Core surpassed the best of the best Francois Legrand and stole the title from the World leader .\nLook for bloody fingernails , hear them speak , share their joy .\nScene Preview The difference between speed and difficulty It s technique versus time ; strength versus speed .\nThe two sportclimbing disciplines difficulty and speed will not produce similar winners .\nThe difficulty discipline requires agility and endurance in order to bring your body and rope to each consecutive carabiner .\nClimbers must have the ability to rest on just fingers or toes while deciphering the best body position and technique for each step .\nSpeedclimbing is about eye-hand synchronicity and flow , with your competitor at your side though hopefully below you .\nThe ability to put your foot where your hand just was with ever increasing speed and without losing upward momentum is the true test .\nKatie Brown In the sportclimbing difficulty discipline , American Katie Brown is not only a two time X Games Gold Medalist , but has won every National event since she began competing in 1995 .\nOh yeah , and she s only 17 and now is allowed to take on the world .\nLast year , France s Liv Sansov and Belgian Muriel Sarkany took second and third , respectively , so stand back because they are sure to be looking for redemption .\nIn the men s division , there s an unfortunate absence of American Chris Sharma , who , with the passage of his 17th birthday , is now also allowed entrance to the adult world of sportclimbing .\nThis rite of passage earlier gained him access to the World Cup circuit , and with that ticket he became the first American man to bring a World Cup win back to the U.\nS. . Sharma injured his knee when he fell while bouldering in Colorado last month .\nThe American veteran is Hans Florine .\nAt the ripe old age of 34 , Hans is the still the speed master , a quality perhaps underestimated last year by fellow American Chris Bloch .\nThe old man attacked the wall with such intensity he had the crowd roaring and not only didn t tire , but seemed to pull himself upward faster and faster .\nBloch was again relegated to second while Hans captured his third X Games gold .\nSo this good natured rivalry is also sure to be Xciting .\nElena Ovchinnikova , 33 , took both the 95 and 97 X Games speedclimbing titles and only missed 96 to give birth to her second child .\nThis transplanted to Las Vegas Siberian will be looking to earn yet a third gold .\nAustralian Abby Watkins settled with silver last year and Mi Sun - Go , of Korea , in a close battle took the bronze .\nThe head-to-head attack format of speedclimbing means even the slightest mistake can lead to not gaps but bridges in the finishes .\nWhile any of these competitors can make scaling the man made 60 foot wall easy only one will do it fast enough to walk away with $ 5,000 .\nStay tuned to The Mountain Zone to see your favorites ascend beginning with the difficulty events Monday , June 22nd followed on Tuesday by the speed events .\nWe ll see you Monday and remember to chalk up your hands so you don t sweat all over your keyboard .\nHans Prosl , Hyper Xtending for The Mountain Zone Mountain Zone Climbing Snowboarding 1998 The Zone Network .\nAll rights reserved .\nMountain Zone Coverage of the X Games\n',076

'Home \\/ Trip Reports Angel Wings , 8\\/00 By Peter Coward On August 12 , a mere three weeks after swearing off marathon approaches , I found myself stumbling back to the car after another long day in the backcountry .\nChan Harrell and I had just climbed the South Arete Direct on Angel Wings in Sequoia National Park , and , hungry and dehydrated as usual , we were hoping to end our little adventure as soon as possible .\nWe had cut out of work a little early Friday to beat traffic , and arrived at the trailhead at the unheard-of hour of 8 30 pm .\nThumbing through the guidebook just outside the park , I rashly suggested that given our early arrival , we should consider doing the 16 mile approach in the dark , maybe catch a couple of hours of sleep at Hamilton Lake , and then tick both Angel Wings and the South Buttress of Cherubim Dome , a so-called unknown classic of the Sierra .\nChan didn t need much convincing , and it seemed like a great plan until a more careful look at the numbers revealed a certain epic drive home Sunday and possible missed flight for me Monday morning to start a trip to the Tetons and Yellowstone with Tatjana .\nSo it was back to the usual -- up at about 3 30am , hiking at 4 , and climbing by about 11 .\nThe route was quite good , though a little dirty on the first few pitches .\nAnd lots of funk , even on the easy pitches .\nWe enjoyed a cloudless sky , and the views were , as always in the Sierra , quite spectacular .\nWe also enjoyed a fairly casual descent , and near-full moon for the hike out .\nThe final tally was 32 miles hiking , 7070 feet elevation gain for the day which was a little surprising given that the net gain from trailhead to summit was only 3500 feet , and the trail doesn t go over any passes , with a car-to-car time of 21 hr 20 min back in time for a few z s before driving home !\n.\nThe following day , T and I headed out to the Tetons for a week .\nWe stayed at the climber s ranch , where climber s from all over the country hang , chat , and scheme their next ascent of the Grand 13,770 ft .\nThese ascents seem to take at least one day for the approach , one for the climb and possibly one for the hike back out to the car .\nSo it turned more than few heads at the Ranch when I soloed the Owens - Spaulding route in 8 hrs ranch to ranch 5.4 , 12-14 miles , 7000 ft elevation gain .\nJackson locals were no doubt more impressed with Rolando Garibrotti s solo of the entire Grand Traverse Teewinot , Owen , the Grand , Middle , South and possibly another summit or two in roughly the same time a couple days earlier .\nLater , I again stunned the ranch denizens when I did a three mile approach AND on-sighted 5.10 - while climbing Caveat Emptor , a fabulous 6 pitch route in death canyon , all in a single day .\nOther highlights in the Tetons included running into Abby Watkins on the summit of the Grand she s guiding for Jackson Mountain Guides this summer , and many terrific hikes and wild animal sightings .\nWe spent the next five days exploring Yellowstone , again enjoying beautiful scenery , wild geysers , hot springs , bubbling mud pools , and Visitor Center videos of bison head-butting hapless tourists .\nExciting stuff .\nThe only bummer was that we didn t see any bears , though we did see paw prints and a total of 5 bison or elk carcasses within sight of the various trails we hiked .\nNow it s back to the usual ...\nCheers , Peter Home \\/ Trip Reports\n\nAngel Wings\n\n',066

'The Nose History and Records Note This stuff was compiled by John Black and its accuracy is questionable .\nPlease , if you have any corrections or additions , email me and let me know !\nHistory and Records The Nose was first climbed by Warren Harding and partners in 45 days , finishing on November 12 , 1958 .\nIt was repeated in 1960 by Royal Robbins , Joe Fitschen , Chuck Pratt , and Tom Frost in a very respectable 6 days .\nIn 1969 , Bauman solos the Nose for the first time El Cap had already been soloed by Robbins the year before he did the Muir Wall .\nIn 1975 , Jim Bridwell , John Long , and Billy Westbay do the Nose-in-a - Day Nia D , for the first time .\nLong led mostly free to the top of Boot Flake , Westbay did the mixed middle section to Camp 5 , and Bridwell nailed !\nto the summit .\nTheir time was about 16 hours .\nIn 1985 , ten years after the Bridwell , Long , Westbay ascent , the Nia D had seen only about 10 repeats .\nIn 1989 , Steve Shipoopi Schneider solos the Nose in 21 22 .\nIn 1990 Merry Braun becomes the first woman to climb the Nia D ; she climbed with her husband Werner Braun .\nThe existing Nia D record is 9 15 , which is first lowered to 8 02 by Florine and Schneider , and then shattered by Peter Croft and Dave Schultz with their 6 40 ascent .\nThey climb most of the route in the dark to avoid passing parties .\nAlso , Don Snyder does the Nia D three times in one season .\nIn 1991 , Hans Florine and Andy Puhvel set the mark at 6 03 , edging out a slightly-improved Croft - Schultz time of 6 10 over last year s record .\nCroft and Schultz replied with another record-shattering ascent this time in daylight of 4 48 !\nIn 1992 Croft teams up with Hans Florine to set the current record 4 22 .\nThe first all-female ascent of the Nia D is done in just under 17 hours by Sue Mc Devitt and Nancy Feagin on the same day !\nCroft later soloed the Steck - Salathe in the same day as a warm-down .\nIn 1993 , Florine sets the record for soloing the Nia D an amazing 14 10 !\nAs a warm-up , Lynn Hill climbs the Nose with Florine in about 8.5 hours the female record ; Hill later frees the Nose as well .\nIn 1994 , Hill does the Nia D the hard way she freeclimbed every pitch !\nIn 1995 , basically nothing happened .\nIn 1996 , Abby Watkins and Vera Wong set the current all-women s Nose record at 16 30 .\nIn 1997 , Galen Rowell becomes the oldest man to climb the Nia D ; the 57 year old acclaimed photographer sent the route in 16 hours , swinging leads with partner Conrad Anker .\nIn 1997 , the Nia D went mainstream in the movie Jerry Maguire when Kelly Preston playing Tom Cruise s fiance utterred those oh-so learned words I ve climbed the 23-hour Nose route to the top of El Capitan in 18 hours and 23 minutes ; I can make THIS work .\nWhat the @ # $ \% ??\nIn 1998 , Hans Florine and Nancy Feagin climb the Nose and Reg Route on Half Dome in 23 30 ; Feagin becomes the first woman to repeat this classic 1986 Bachar - Croft enchainment .\nThe pair climbed the Nose in 9 35 missing the female record , held by Hill , and climbed Half Dome in 6 02 .\nIn 1999 , Hans Florine does the Nia D for the 20th time .\nAlso , Herson and Harrell become the only other pair to link the Salathe and the Nose in a push 26hrs .\nDean Potter lowers the Nia D solo record to 12 59 .\nIn 2001 , Hans Florine and Tommy Caldwell showed that the 1992 Nia D record of 4 22 was not out of reach they clocked the second fastest time ever at 4 31 .\nA couple of weeks later , Dean Potter and Timmy O Neill set the new mark at 3 59 35 .\nTwo weeks later Hans Florine answered back with partner Jim Herson to lower the record by a little more than 2 minutes , clocking in at 3 57 28 .\nNot to be discouraged , Potter and O Neill went back up five days later and set the current record 3 24 04 .\nI m sure Florine would have answered back had Winter not arrived soon thereafter .\nIn 2002 , Hans Florine and Yuji Hirayama sliced another 35 minutes off the current record to set the new current mark 2 48 55 .\nMy prediction is that this record will stand for a long time .\nTimmy O Neill thinks it could go much faster if a few cardio monsters did a lap , but the combination of world-class aerobic fitness and the ability to climb 5.11 with big run-outs is something we re not likely to see in the near future .\nEnchainments The Nia D is often done by super-climbers in conjunction with other routes .\nThe first , and most famous , of these is the 1986 John Bachar and Peter Croft climb of the Nose followed by the Reg Route on Half Dome in the same day .\nThey put up a time of 10 hours for the Nose and then , amazingly , passed 7 parties , climbed through the rain , and set the Half Dome record in just over 4 hours , which lasted until 1996 .\nIn 1999 , Dean Potter soloed the Nose and Half Dome in the same day .\nTwo days later , Hans Florine did this as well !\nEl Cap was first climbed twice in the same day in 1990 when Croft and Schultz climbed the Nose and the Salathe in a total time of 20.5 hours .\nEl Cap was first climbed three times in one day in 1994 by Florine and Schneider the pair climbed the Nose 5 42 , the West Face 4 31 , and Lurking Fear 8 52 , using fixed ropes for descent , and pre-caching water .\nIn 1999 , Dean Potter soloed the Nose , then Half - Dome , in the same day .\nA few days later , Hans Florine repeated this feat in 20 40 , doing the routes in the reverse order starting the watch at the base of Half Dome and stopping at the top of El Cap .\nPerhaps one of the most amazing enchainments is Potter and O Neill s link-up of Half Dome s Regular Route , the South Face of Watkins , and the Nose in under 24 hours .\nThe pair started Half Dome at 10am , Watkins at 4pm , and the Nose around midnight ... hard core !\nNose-in-a - Day Page History and Records\n',064

the SE ridge of the Tour Ronde ; the Cosmiques Ar te , and Mont Blanc via the traverse of Mont Blanc du Tacul and Mont Maudit on the descent from which Joan had to shepherd a suddenly flu-stricken and helpless Kathy back to her hotel bed ; before heading over to Zermatt where they had the great luck of good weather and conditions on the Matterhorn .\nJoan and Kathy were thrilled to succeed on both Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn , a combination requiring both great stamina and excellent luck with the weather .\nJoan had both .\nSusan and Roy on Mont Blanc du Tacul .\nPhoto Info Alas , such luck was not to bless Jon Penn , during his second attempt to climb the Matterhorn , this time with Kathy .\nJon is ready , willing and itchin to get that peak , but a truly huge dump of snow put it out of reach during the time he had for it this year .\nJon did get in a climb of the Wellenkuppe and Obergabelhorn , a big climb with great views , involving plenty of variety and challenge both on rock and on icy snow slopes .\nThe route was generously smattered with ice and newly fallen snow , which along with a chill , stiff wind made for a tough , long and satisfying climb .\nAn attempt the following day on the Zinalrothorn was foiled by the same multi-day storm that thwarted the Matterhorn attempt as well .\nInstead , after an amusing , drizzly , slippery descent of the via ferrata in the Gorner Gorge , they headed over to Monte Rosa , only to be turned back by an icy , flesh-freezing wind !\nSometimes the mountains can be cruel .\nWhile Kathy and Jon were freezing their butts in Zermatt , Emery Dameron was met by Mark in Chamonix , where they climbed the Index and Cosmiques Ar te despite a nagging knee injury of Emery s. Chris Kulp the intrepid was back in the Alps with Mark in August .\nThey got in several great rock routes before a variation of the Chamonix Plague that was still circulating , put Chris down for several days and foiled an attempt on the Meije in the Ecrins region near La Grave .\nFeeling better for the Innominata route on Mont Blanc , they were turned back by weather that was too good !\nThe hot sun made crossing the central couloir high on the route inadvisable .\nStill , among the great routes they explored together were the Aiguille du Peigne , The Fl che Rousse on the Aiguille d Argenti re , Mani Puliti in the Aiguilles Rouges , the Tour des Crochues by the Galbert route , and Tchao Godillo in the Col de la Colombi re .\nChris Kulp on the Traverse of the Aiguille d Entr ves .\nThe Aiguille verte in the background .\nPhoto Info Emery on the Aiguille de l Index Photo Info Chris Kulp on Mani Puliti , a great rock route in the Aiguilles Rouges .\nPhoto Info Chris hams it up on the summit of the Aiguille d Argenti re .\nPhoto Info Finally , Kathy headed over to the Dolomites to join a contingent of the Latham family Andy , wife Jan , and sons Adam and Stephen .\nThey had fun in the sun , climbing sport and multi-pitch routes on fine limestone , and sampling some of the airy , exciting and historic via ferrata near the town of Cortina , enjoying great pasta and coffee !\nAfter a day of sight seeing en famille in Venice , Andy and Kathy saw Jan and the boys off at the Milan airport , and drove to Switzerland for a last few productive days climbing before their time ran out .\nThey had good weather , and quickly climbed the Jungfrau , followed by the Eiger via the Mittellegi Ridge and South Ridge descent .\nThis exciting , extremely exposed ridge climb was a long , committing , beautiful climb on a gorgeous day .\nFollowing that , with one day left , they drove over to Piz Bernina and climbed the beautiful mixed ridge on the Piz Palu , before parting company in Milan .\nCho Oyu as seen from Base Camp .\nThe wind blows a big lenticular over the summit .\nPhoto Info Chris and Kathy on Mount Conness .\nPhoto Info A Winter at Home mostly We hadn t been home long before Chris Kulp made the drive over the hill for a quick climb of the North Ridge of Conness , a great fall day .\nThis winter we have been working away on a writing project , and skiing and climbing too .\nSince January our skis have had less use than our ice climbing gear however .\nKim Mc Elhinney and Hugh Driscoll came out for a weekend at Lee Vining with Kathy , while Mark roped up with several other visitors Chris Kulp , Frank Sainburg of Avila Beach , Wanda Neste of Palm Springs , and Scott Anderson of Pacific Palisades .\nIn late January Kathy headed back to Ouray , Colorado for the 3rd annual Chicks With Picks event hosted by Kim Reynolds of San Juan Mountain Guides of Ouray .\nThis year Chicks was better attended and organized even than before .\nThe clinic was expanded to include a few more participants , and several new , extremely strong and professional guides joined the line-up Carolyn Parker , Abby Watkins , Mattie Sheafor , Anna Keeling and Amy Bullard joined the established group of Kitty Calhoun , Angela Hawse , Jen Grimes and Kathy .\nThe depth and strength of this group of instructors allows women of all levels of experience and ability , from absolute beginners to experienced leaders and mixed climbers , to be challenged and get a lot of climbing and learning in a short time .\nAbby and Kathy gave well-received slide shows attended by the chicks as well as by local residents and visiting climbers .\nThese events , featuring auctions and a bar stocked by a local brewery cheap gear and free beer , benefit a local women s shelter and every year raise more money for a great cause .\nKathy says she feels honored and privileged to be a part of this event , which she looks forward to every February .\nNow we re breaking in our tight little rock shoes , and trying to get out rock climbing in the Owens River Gorge a couple of times per week .\nSpring is just around the corner , and we want to be in shape for it , and for y all !\nWHAT S NEXT FOR 2002 ?\nMarch Sunny Rock Frozen Ice At the end of March , Kathy heads to Joshua Tree to join Marian Marbury of Adventures in Good Company for a week of rock climbing with another fun group of women .\nMark will be climbing on spikes on the still-frozen waterfalls of Banff , with Chris Kulp for our annual pilgrimage .\nSkiing toward the Col du Belvedere .\nThe Chamonix Aiguilles and Mont Blanc Massif behind .\nPhoto Info April and May Alps Ski Tours Mark and Kathy will meet at the L.

'Speed Freak Interview with Steve Shipoopy Schneider 9 May 97 Melbourne , Australia The first time I saw Steve Schnider was in a climbing video .\nHe was explaining the ins and outs of competition climbing on a tiny wall in what appeared to be someone s backyard .\nI remembered this espically because I wondered at the time , Who is this guy and why the hell have they let him on this video ?\n.\nHis little skit was very funny but he seemed to be too much of a clown .\nI wondered why they hadn t picked a serious climber for the role .\nThis , I was to find out , was my first introduction to what seems to be Steve Shipoopy Schnieder s motto , seriously , but never seriously .\nIt was later that I found out that Shipoopy the name Steve Schneider sounds too serious for this guy wasn t just the court jester , he was also a very serious climber .\nThe clown I saw in the video was a certified UIAA course setter .\nAt this stage he has climbed over 100 routes graded 5.13 , climbed El Cap 43 times , he is at the cutting edge setting new records of speed and endurance .\nHe s definately more than a clown .\nAustralia holds a very special place for Shipoopy as he owes his initial break throughs to Australian influences .\nHe climbed in Europe under the tutorlege of Kim Carrigan .\nCarrigan , who was one of the top climbers at that stage , took him under his wing to train as a prodigere .\nThis had a strong influence on Shipoopy as it was competing with Carrigan that he realized his potential .\nHe laughs as he explains how Carrigan would get a little tweaked when his supremecy was challenged by this unknown American upstart .\nSometime later Shpoopy spent three months climbing in Australia .\nHere again he was influenced by Australia .\nUnder the influence of the locals he abandoned his purist ethics and starting hangdoging .\nThe results amazed him and showed up pretty soon .\nHe climbed his first three 5.13 s at Arapps Ogiver , Slinking Leopard and India .\nHe has climbed over 100 5.13 since .\nShpoopy has now made a name for himself speed climbing in the Yosemite Valley .\nAlong with the likes of Hans Florine , Peter Croft and Dave Schultz , he has helped push speed and endurance records to amazing levels .\nAt one point he set the speed record for the Nose 21hrs 22minutes .\nHe has set endurance records by climbing three grade VI big wall climbs in one day pushes , all in one week ; West Butteress VI 5.10 A3 + , Chinese Water Torture VI 5.11 A4 and Dihedral Wall VI 5.9 A3 .\nAll these climbs were done in fastest times to date .\nThis feat remains unrepeated .\nWith Hans Florine he climbed three El Cap routes in a day ; Nose VI 5.11 A3 , Lurking Fear VI 5.10 A3 and West Face VI 5.11 b .\nHis climb Circus Circus reputed to be the most sustained climb in America when it was put up in 1992 , still awaits a second ascent .\nThis 500 foot route has successive pitches of 5.12 c , 5.13 a , 5.12 c , 5.13 c , 5.10 a , 5.11 a.\nIt took 17 days to put up and he red pointed the route without taking any falls .\nHe s definately the unchallenged clown at his circus .\nI caught up with him on his second trip to Australia .\nHe was on a lecture tour but he still found time to climb , tell bad blond jokes , give instructional clinics and ofcourse , laugh .\nShipoopy is a man who is as serious about having fun as he is about having more fun .\nHave you done any climbing in Australia ?\nTen years ago I was here .\nI climbed in Australia for three months and in New Zealand for six weeks .\nI had a great time .\nI actually led my first 5.13 here in Australia .\nWhich one was that ?\nOgiver was my first and then I did India and Slinking Leopard .\nThat must have been a real break through for you .\nIt was a breakthrough .\nI adopted the hangdog tactics of the locals .\nI used to be very pure and not like hanging on the rope .\nI started doing what the locals did and began to climb really hard .\nI really liked it .\nDo you plan to do any climbing this trip ?\nOh yeah .\nI climbed Ozymandieas Direct with Abby Watkins .\nWe got some good information and we broke the record first try by 90 seconds !\nBriefly could you tell me a bit about the history of speed climbing in the Yosemite valley ?\nIt s a long proud history .\nThe forefathers Robins , Roper those guys always took a watch along in the 50 s and 60 s and saw how fast they could go .\nI spoke to Roper , one of the pioneers in the 60 s who wrote the first guide book , and he felt that there was a bit of a competitive thing going on from the out set .\nPeople would go up there with a watch and measure up their time .\nIf someone broke a record , someone would get really pissed and shatter that one .\nThey would get this record war going on ; they are still going on .\nHans Florine , would get his Nose record broken and would go back better it .\nThen Peter Croft would beat it .\nHe figured the only way to keep it there would be to tie up with Peter Croft .\nThey set the 4 22 record that s held on for 4 years now and good luck to anyone who wants to beat that .\nThat s 4 22 over how many feet of climbing ?\nApproximately 3000 feet .\nThat s absolutely flying .\nIf you wanted to divide 4 22 by 34 pitches you ll get their minutes per pitch .\nThat s pretty impressive too .\nIs there any official way of measuring the time ?\nThe way speed climbers are measured when the first person starts climbing , that s when the clock gets started and it is stopped when the last climber and\\/or the haul bag is pulled up over the edge .\nWhen the guy s jumars hit the anchors , that s when the clock stops .\nHas speed climbing developed because of the intensity of the scene in the Yosemite valley ?\nI think it s just the competitive nature of man .\nThe thrill of victory and the drama of athetlic competition .\nYou see it in the Olympics and it just transfers over to climbing .\nPartly because there are some really great climbers that have gathered in Yosemite and have got really good at doing these things .\nSeeing that you have done so much speed climbing - what do you think of the early speed ascents that were done in the early 60 s by people like Royal Robins .\nEspecially without the modern gear like friends .\nI think its phenomenal .\nThey were banging pitons .\nSteve Roper did the first grade VI in America , back in 66 , the Regular Route on the Half Dome .\nHe was gambling .\nThey didn t have head lamps back in those days .\nBasically if they got caught out by night they would have to shiver it out till the morning .\nSteve says he remembers being there , before first light of the day , piton in his hand , just waiting for it to be light enough so he could see where to put it .\nHe just charged it .\nHe probably put 250 pitons in and out with his partner Jeff Foott that day .\nSurely no one have had used that many pitons like that .\nThey just finished up in the light of the day .\nI just find it phenomenal that they just had this amazing craft of using pitons fast , not over driving them .\nThat art of using pitons like that is lost because we use friends in anything over a one inch crack .\nIn 1966 Steve Roper and Jeff Foott climbed the first grade VI in a one day ascent .\nWhy do you think it took nearly a decade for that feat to be repeated ?\nWell partly because the Half Dome is 2000ft and the Nose is 3000ft .\nSo it was another big step up .\nNo one actually thought he could do it .\nCould you describe the reaction of the climbing community when the North American Wall was climbed in a day in October 1990 .\nIt was the route which was considered to be the hardest in the world when it was first climbed in 64 .\nThere was alot of debate behind that .\nGuys like Peter Croft said that those guys climbed it in 24 05 .\nSteve Gerbeding , Scott Stowe and Rick Lovelace were that honest .\nPeter Croft enraged those guys because he said , you guys didn t do it .\nNow we are going to go up and do it in a day .\nTo Gerbeding it didn t matter because they had done it single push .\nIt didn t matter if it was 24 05 or 23 55 .\nThe thing is that they had gone up without the haulbag and done it .\nThere were mixed reactions to that .\nThere was a claim to the first true one day ascent of the North American Wall when it was done by Hans Florin and party when they did it in 21 hours something .\nThe thing is that wouldn t have done it that fast or felt that they could do it that fast unless Steve had done it before them .\nDespite the mixed reaction , it was a big milestone .\nIn 64 the North American Wall was considered the hardest technical rock route in the world .\nIt was that route that brought a real notoriety to the Yosemite Valley .\nTo have that route be climbed in a single push was absolutely mind blowing to the first ascentist and alot of other people , myself included .\nAre you familiar with that route ?\nHow many pitches is it ?\nAround 28ish .\nHaven t climbed it yet .\nSaving it for that one day onsight .\nLaughs How does speed climbing differ from normal big wall climbing ?\nThe main thing is you don t have a haul bag and you have to be willing to climb at night .\nNot having the haul bag frees you from alot of extra work .\nIt also gives you the commitment that you have to get up the wall otherwise you are going to have a really uncomfortable night out .\nYou are committed to climb fast .\nYou ve done your ground work .\nYou ve done your grade IVs , your grade Vs in a day .\nYou are ready to go fast .\nYou ve got less water .\nBecause you are committed to going fast and going at night .\nYou just do it .\nAre there any major differences in technique ?\nIt s not so much technique .\nAlot of it is just beta .\nHow to do these routes faster .\nWhen to combine pitches .\nBasically its the same thing leaning , cleaning , hauling .\nYou just keep your ropes really neat .\nHave a team of three working efficiently together as a team has been worked to a perfection in the last few years more than anything .\nIn one week you climbed three Grade VIs in one day pushes , West Buttress , Chinese Water Torture and the Dihedral Wall .\nWhat were your thoughts at the end of that week ?\nWhat s the next step ?\nCan I do four in a week ?\nWhat s the next challenge ?\nMy body went through alot .\nIt was a real test of my body .\nEvery once in a while I want to test it to see what it can do and really push it .\nI was just amazed that I could go on like that .\nIt s seeing what I can do , then learning from that and maybe adding on to it somehow .\nIt s a progressive thing .\nHas anyone else done three Grade VIs in that short a stretch of time ?\nWell I did three El Cap routes in a day .\nBut they weren t onsight routes so that was a different thing .\nThat particular trifecta hasn t been repeated .\nHow many times have you climbed El Cap ?\n43 times as of this conversation .\nI hope to get to 50 by the end of the year .\nWhat s the attraction of climbing it that many times ?\nOh its fun .\nYou can go up on a weekend and blast it in a speed climb .\nYou come down and you are absolutely hammering .\nYou go back to work Monday morning and you don t even care because your hands are just raw .\nYou have this huge smile across your face when you do the Captain .\nIts absolutely addicting , totally phenomenal when you are up there and it s fun .\nBetter than a carnival ride times ten .\nWhat was the initial reaction to John Bachar and Peter Croft s one day ascent of the Nose on El Cap and the Regular Route on the Half Dome ?\nI think there wasn t too much surprise .\nI think people realized that it could be done .\nI had done two El Cap routes in a day .\nSo it was just a natural progression that someone did .\nPeople who didn t know what had gone on before might have been surprised but really it was one of the next steps in things to do .\nCould you tell me a bit about your climb Circus Circus ?\nIt was reputed to be the hardest sustained route in America It has successive pitches of 5.12 c , 5.13 a , 5.12 c , 5.13 c , 5.10 a , 5.11 a.\n.\nDoes it still hold that reputation ?\nNo , Salathe , the Nose , the Direct Route , all free , on the Half Dome are all harder .\nIt was up there in 1990 .\nIt was one of the hardest for sure .\nTop three long hard routes .\nThere were very few routes that were that long that had multiple pitches of 5.13 on them .\nAtleast that I know about .\nIt was just a personally satisfying thing to do .\nI wasn t out there to put up the hardest single free climb .\nI was just drawn to this amazing line that I could see from the road .\nI just had to do it .\nFate and destiny kind of control my life in these things .\nThere are just some things that I had to do .\nI was so amazing that that climb was even possible when you look at it from the ground .\nIt looks desperately thin and it looks like it isn t going to go and it does , barely .\nStill awaits a second ascent .\nSpeed climbing is obviously extremely intense .\nThings like the Peter Croft and Dave Schultz duo climbing 42 pitches in a day sounds absolutely incredible .\nThose guys are a phenomenal team .\nBut even they had limits .\nThey tried to do a quadvecta .\nThey did Higher Cathedral Rock by Mary s Tears , climbed the Rostrum , climbed the West Face of El Cap went to do Astroman and they were getting tired .\nPeter remembers getting to the top of the second pitch and Dave s hanging off a quarter inch bolt with a bomber friend crack right next to him .\nPeter couldn t for the life of him explain to him that he should have backed up the anchor .\nHe was like , Huuuuh , whaaat .\nThey realized that they d better get down .\nThey ve been pushing it too hard .\nThey couldn t tell the difference between a hallucination from a bolt .\nBut its rad they tried it .\nThose two formed one of the best speed climbing teams ever .\nTheir Rostrum time is like 1 45 .\nThey just free soloed this thing .\nThey simol climbed this thing and they were fast .\nWhen I did it with Wally it took 5-6 hours .\nThat s four or five times as long .\nThe times involved are incredible enough and then they get bettered constantly .\nYou soloed the nose in 21 hours something and then Hans Florine comes along and does it in 14 hours .\nI did the Nose in 21 22 and Hans climbed it in 14 57 .\nHe really shattered that record .\nTo top that that was his first rope solo ever !\nHow does the climbing differ style at Toulomie Meadows differ from Yosemite ?\nYosemite valley is characteristic of very parallel cracks that lack alot of face holds .\nThese force pretty hard difficult , finger wrenching , toe binding climbing maneuvers .\nToulomie has all these protuberances or knobs and face edges .\nYou can climb vertical faces much more naturally there than in the Yosemite valley .\nFor me it developed a technique of being very technical on dead vertical faces with my feet .\nBeing able to stay on really tiny edges really came to be an art form in Toulomie .\nYou see alot of climbers who climb at Toulomie , John Bachar , Kurt Smith and Ed Barry , in competitions their foot work does them wonders .\nIn your article Sea of Domes you describe the tension the ethical wars has created there .\nThe clash of ethics between ground up climbers like John Bachar and rap bolters such as Ron Kauk .\nOh yeah .\nI don t think Ron s ever forgiven me for that article .\nIts never been the same between us but I just told it like it is .\nWhen you do something as public as chopping someone else s route I think you have to live up to it .\nIf you aren t ready to do that maybe you shouldn t do it in the first place .\nI chopped bolts once and it was a big mistake .\nI was sorry the next day .\nI was drunk when I did it .\nI learned my lesson .\nI ll never chop bolts again .\nThere was a big issue of ethics when Toulomie was started to get repelled placed bolts .\nI wanted to keep it a traditional area , to do routes from the bottom to the top .\nWhat was going to happen was that these routes were going to be done quicker than I could have done then in the traditional way .\nThe rock would get used up because it is so limited .\nIt came to a point where I had to make a choice weather to keep my friends or my ethics .\nI chose my friends .\nI chose to accept rap bolting rather than fight against it and make a bunch of enemies .\nSo rap bolting is becoming very popular there ?\nYeah it s done all the time .\nI never do it though because I still love that adventure of not knowing if a routes going to go .\nI wouldn t ask anybody else to put routes from the ground up .\nI don t push any kind of ethics on any other people .\nYou want to set the bolts in the right place ; sport climbing is an easier way of doing it .\nI manage to put the bolts in the right place by spending years doing it and being smart about it ground up style .\nBut I think everybody has to just do what s right for them .\nI will respect them for that .\nDo you ever think the Toulomie testpiece Bachar \\/ Yerian will ever be rap bolted ?\nIt might be possible but they would get chopped .\nI would chop them if someone did that .\nThat would be a blight to everyone who has gone up there and gotten the guts to do that route .\nThat would be shitting on them .\nIt would be bringing it down from another level .\nYou can fall from almost anywhere on the route and you won t die , you ll get hurt .\nSo its not like you are looking at a death fall .\nYou have to really build yourself into this spiritual mind awareness plane of really keeping your mind in control in the face of a big fall .\nIt s been one of the best experiences .\nPeople have come from all over the world to do that route .\nSo anyone who would put bolts into that , I can tell you would be slandered for life .\nAt the end of your article you sign off as a wanna be alpinist .\nHave you done any alpine climbing .\nI climbed Denali a few years ago .\nI went to Patagonia and looking to go to California and do some peaks there .\nI want to get into it .\nI would like to go to the Himalaya and do some really high peaks .\nWould you be interested in doing something like what Wolfgang Gullich did in the Trango Towers ?\nFree climbing up that high ?\nI would like to do those sort of things but I don t know who practical it is to really free climb there .\nTo free climb in the mountains takes a long time .\nYou are not going fast and speed is safety in alot of the mountains .\nDon t get me wrong , I would love to go up to the Trango Towers and free climb the Eternal Flame that Wolfgang and Kurt did in 88 .\nPhenomenal route but in a way its not that practical ; you ve gut to have decide whether , a certain section might take you two days to do ... My whole speed climbing background has given me this attitude of just getting to the top getting down and then getting on something else .\nMore summits , I want to do more .\nQuantity not quality .\nI want to do it all .\nDo you have any big projects planned in the near future ?\nI ve been injured for nine months since my honeymoon .\nIt s a tendon thing ; a honeymoon injury .\nI have no big projects planned except getting healthy .\nI plan to do some walls because that doesn t hammer my wrist as much as extreme free climbing .\nI dream of getting back to really hard climbing , back up to the level of 5.14 but I keep getting injured left and right .\nIn the last three years I ve broken three ribs kayaking , broken my leg in two places climbing last year and three months later I injured my tendon wind surfing .\nI m just having a hard time staying healthy right now .\nMAIL ME HOME PAGE\nSTEVE SHIPOOPY SCHNEIDER\n',119

'2\\/15\\/04 - Skiers Rally Against Recent Yellowstone Decision More than 100 Protest Court Ruling Overturning Parks Snowmobile Ban West Yellowstone , Montana More than 100 skiers from around the nation gathered in Yellowstone National Park to speak out against Tuesday s federal court ruling that again allows snowmobile use in the park .\nWe must preserve this park now , before it s too late , said Haidee Wilson from North Carolina .\nThis park is a national , possibly even an international gem , and we must do what we can to ensure that future generations can visit Yellowstone in its original state .\nThe rally , hosted by Winter Wildlands Alliance WWA took place just inside the park s West Gate , which is now the entryway for up to 440 snowmobiles per day .\nOn Tuesday , U. S. District Judge Clarence Brimmer issued a temporary restraining order that suppresses a pending ban on snowmobiling in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks .\nBrimmer ruled that without the order , companies that rely on snowmobiling in the parks would suffer irreparable harm because of lost business .\nI m upset that Brimmer s decision completely ignores us skiers and snowshoers , said Mack Bray from Jackson Hole , Wyoming .\nWe stay in hotels , eat in restaurants , and have money that is as green as anyone else s. But we can t recreate here in the midst of pollution and engine noise .\nWithout a ban , there s just no point in us coming here .\nA Dec. 16 ruling by U. S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan reinstated a Clinton-era plan to phase out snowmobile use in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks .\nThe effect of the court s ruling would have been to reduce snowmobile use in the parks this year by half and eliminate snowmobile use next year .\nMany residents of the Park s gateway community of West Yellowstone expressed concerns that the Dec. 16 ruling would reduce winter tourism dollars .\nWWA s event was to be an attempt at re-introducing human-powered winter recreationists to the park .\nMany skiers and snowshoers avoided Yellowstone in the winter because it was previously considered to be a haven of motorized recreation .\nWinter Wildlands expects the long-term effect of a snowmobile ban in the parks to actually be an increase in tourism dollars as more user-groups flock to a safer , quieter , more pristine Yellowstone , while snowmobilers continue to utilize the more than 1,000 miles of snowmobile trails just outside the Park .\nWWA officials estimated that the 105 attendees of their celebration pumped more than $ 40,000 into local economies .\nSkiers and snowshoers have told us they re ready to return to places like West Yellowstone and we re confident they ll play a key role in expanding the community s tourism base , once snowmobile use is banned from our parks , said WWA Executive Director Sally Grimes .\nWith a complete phase-out of snowmobiles still scheduled for next winter , Grimes said it is critical that the Park Service , Congress , local businesses and government leaders , and recreation organizations like WWA work together to find new ways to draw more winter visitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities .\nWinter Wildlands is calling for a modernization of the Yellowstone snowcoach fleet and better education of the public on the diverse winter recreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone .\nBased in Boise , Idaho , Winter Wildlands represents more than 19 million skiers , snowshoers , snowboarders , and other non-motorized snowsports enthusiasts .\nIt is the lone recreation group among the six plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the National Park Service s winter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks .\nAbout Winter Wildlands Alliance Founded in 2000 , Winter Wildlands Alliance promotes and preserves winter wildlands and a quality human-powered snowsports experience on public lands .\nBy working with grassroots groups across the country on local issues and as the national public policy and land management regulation watchdog for skiers and snowshoers throughout the country , Winter Wildlands Alliance ensures that future generations will be able to enjoy a safe , quiet and pristine winter recreation experience .\nFor more information , contact Ken Miller , Public Policy Manager , at 208.344.8692 Cell 208 890.3944 or visit www.winterwildlands.org .\n2\\/13\\/04 - Skiers Say Court Setback Underscores Need for Yellowstone Rally 300 Expected in Park for Valentine s Day Show of Support for Yellowstone WEST YELLOWSTONE , MT - Fresh from a U. S. District Court ruling that suddenly and dramatically increased the number of snowmobiles allowed in Yellowstone National Park the rest of this winter , skiers and other winter recreationists are coming to Yellowstone this weekend to rally in support of the park and re-assert their demand to eliminate the machines from the park .\nThe ruling in Wyoming is a huge disappointment , especially since four federal judges in Washington , D. C. , soundly rejected the governments push to keep snowmobiles in Yellowstone , Winter Wildlands Alliance Executive Director Sally Grimes said .\nBut this setback only underscores the need for skiers , snowshoers and other non-motorized snowsports enthusiasts from around the nation to rally once again in Yellowstone in support of the park and all it represents .\nThe fight for a clean , healthy , and quiet Yellowstone is far from over and we are more energized than ever .\nAs it did last Presidents Day weekend , Winter Wildlands Alliance is inviting members and supporters from across the United States to gather in Yellowstone on Valentines Day to voice their support for the park .\nAn estimated 300 supporters are expected to attend both a Friday night pre-rally reception and the main event on Saturday morning just inside Yellowstones west entrance .\nThe rally comes just four days after U. S. District Court Judge Clarence Brimmer in Wyoming blocked the phase-out of snowmobile use underway in Yellowstone by ruling in favor of the snowmobile industry and the state of Wyoming .\nThe snowmobile industry and the state are battling to keep snowmobiles in Yellowstone despite National Park Service studies that show the way to best protect the park is to ban the machines .\nWinter Wildlands joined five national and regional conservation and environmental groups in fighting to restore the three-year-old snowmobile phase-out launched by the Clinton administration but overturned by the Bush White House .\nU. S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington agreed with the coalition in December , overturning the Bush administration plan to allow more snowmobiles in Yellowstone and ordering the Park Service to begin the phase-out .\nThat ruling was later upheld by an appellate panel .\nBut this week the Wyoming judge halted the phase-out , prompting the Park Service to immediately begin allowing vastly more machines into the park than allowed so far this winter .\nThe Park Services answer to this controversy is no answer at all , Grimes said .\nIt is now allowing 780 machines into Yellowstone , up from the 493 that were allowed before this ruling .\nThose who have visited the park so far this winter have been amazed at how much quieter and cleaner it is this year .\nNow , we are back to business as usual .\nYellowstone will be louder , dirtier , and less healthy this weekend than it was last weekend .\nThis is Americas park , and Americans have spoken overwhelmingly in favor of the snowmobile ban that the Park Service says is needed to protect Yellowstone .\nInstead of looking for ways to get more snowmobiles into Yellowstone , we should be focusing on finding the resources needed to get more visitors into the park on snowcoaches , just as the Park Service suggested three years and millions of dollars worth of studies ago .\nDuring the course of this weekend , Winter Wildlands will be encouraging Yellowstone rally participants to redouble efforts to contact their elected officials in Washington and to step up lobbying on behalf of a snowmobile-free Yellowstone .\nWinter Wildlands has joined such groups as The Wilderness Society , National Parks Conservation Association , Greater Yellowstone Coalition , Natural Resources Defense Council , the Sierra Club , and the Natural Trails and Waters Coalition in campaigning to remove snowmobiles from the two parks , as recommended by the Park Service in 2000 , before the Park Service reversed itself after being sued by the snowmobile industry .\nWith thousands of miles of groomed snowmobile trails surrounding Yellowstone , there are ample opportunities for snowmobilers to enjoy their sport without harming the park and ruining the visitor experience .\nFounded in 2000 by grassroots groups throughout the country , Winter Wildlands Alliance is the only national organization working to protect a quality human-powered winter recreation experience .\nFor more information , contact Sally Grimes , Executive Director , at 208.336.4203 or visit www.winterwildlands.org Note to Reporters Winter Wildlands Alliance will be posting photos for your use from Saturdays rally on our website www.winterwildlands.org by mid-afternoon Saturday .\nWWA staff can be reached via cell phone in West Yellowstone through noon Saturday .\nFor the rest of the weekend , Ken Miller can be reached at the Snow Lodge at Old Faithful at 307 344-7901 , possibly via cell depending on conditions , or through my Boise number .\nCredit for the photos is Dave Long .\n2\\/6\\/04 - Bear Valley Telemark Festival News A foot of new snow just landed on the slopes of Bear Valley , CA .\nWe are excited to see new and old friends and wanted to pass along some information to help maximize your festival experience .\nIn short , more instructors , more demos and more staff .\nThis year s festival is looking to be the best ever .\nThere are still a few spaces in all events except the Saturday Banquet .\nSo tell your friends to sign up today and become part of the most spirited telemark event in the country .\nWith online reservation -LRB- http \\/ \\/ rd.bcentral.com \\/ ?\nID = 1469322 s = 74339056 -RRB- it has never been easier !\nIf you have any questions or suggestions please do not hesitate to contact M.

Skiers Can Help Yellowstone Towns Cope With Snowmobile Rule Judge s ruling on park sleds presents new opportunity to expand winter economies .\nBOISE , ID - A federal court ruling against the Bush administration s snowmobile plan for Yellowstone National Park will create short-term hardship for some businesses outside Yellowstone , but will be a boon to others and presents a rare opportunity for towns such as West Yellowstone to diversify their economies , the nation s first and only organization representing non-motorized winter recreationists said .\nWe understand there will be some local economic disruption as a result of this ruling , but we also know skiers and other winter recreation enthusiasts will flock to Yellowstone and its gateway communities once snowmobiles are no longer in the park , said Winter Wildlands Alliance Executive Director Sally Grimes .\nSkiers have been telling us they re ready to return to places like West Yellowstone , and we re confident they ll play a key role as the community expands its tourism base .\nWinter Wildlands , based in Boise , represents more than 17 million skiers , snowshoers , snowboarders , and other non-motorized snowsports enthusiasts .\nIt is the lone recreation group among the six plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the National Park Service s winter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks .\nU. S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan on Wednesday set aside the Park Service s plan to allow nearly 1,000 snowmobiles a day into Yellowstone and Grand Teton , reinstating a Clinton-era plan to phase out snowmobile use in both parks .\nThe effect of the court s ruling is to reduce snowmobile use in the parks this year by half , eliminating it next year .\nThe important thing for Yellowstone and for those who want to enjoy its natural beauty in the winter is to move ahead as soon as possible toward replacing snowmobiles with more snowcoaches to allow all Americans to visit Yellowstone in the winter , Grimes said .\nYellowstone is not closed this winter , nor will it be closed next winter .\nAll Americans will still enjoy access to this special place .\nNow that the court has ruled , it s up to all of us to work with the Park Service and the communities surrounding these magnificent parks to expand winter recreation opportunities in and around the parks .\nGrimes said it s critical that the Park Service , Congress , local businesses and government leaders , and snowmobile organizations work together to find new ways to draw more winter visitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities .\nThat includes askig Congress for more funds to expand the Yellowstone snowcoach fleet and to better educate the public on diverse winter recreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone .\nFor instance , the Park Service was prepared to spend more than $ 1 million in tax dollars this winter to assess snowmobile pollution levels and other impacts , and to hire more law enforcement officers .\nThat money can now be used to expand local economies .\nThe visiting public needs to be made aware that tomorrow , next week , and throughout the winter they can continue to visit Yellowstone s popular attractions , Grimes said .\nSkiers and snowshoers will return , and we think this can be a win-win case for everyone .\nIt s our hope that rather than being known as just the snowmobile capitol of the world , towns like West Yellowstone will become known as the Winter Wonderland of the world .\nOther groups involved in the Yellowstone snowmobile case are Greater Yellowstone Coalition , National Parks Conservation Association , The Wilderness Society , Natural Resources Defense Council , and Sierra Club .\nThe organizations were represented by Earthjustice .\nGrimes said Winter Wildlands plans to hold its annual skier rally for Yellowstone as scheduled this Valentine s Day .\nWWA expects more than 300 skiers , snowshoers , and others to fill West Yellowstone hotels and restaurants over the long Presidents Day weekend , as they did last year , in a show of economic support for local businesses .\nWWA officials will also seek to meet with local business leaders on how skiers can play a role in expanding the town s winter economy .\nFounded in 2000 by grassroots groups throughout the country , Winter Wildlands Alliance is the only national organization working to protect a quality human-powered winter recreation experience .\nFor more information , contact Sally Grimes , Executive Director , at 208.336.4203 or visit www.winterwildlands.org .\n10\\/26\\/03 -

James 20\\/04\\/20049 47 21 AM Mark Moorhead was climbing rock routes within a few grades of the upper limit of the time late 70s early 80s he went missing\\/died on an 8000m mountain .\nI m yet to hear of any other Australians doing the same , although some have come close - grade 24\\/25 8000m mountains .\nRupert 20\\/04\\/200411 47 57 AM Andrew Lindblade and Athol Whimp ?\nDamietta 20\\/04\\/200411 53 10 AM Rupy , and Simon Parsons IN the same league but not pushing the free climbing grades quite as high John Fantini , Vera Wong , Abby Watkins , Greg Child , John Muir , Andrew Mc Cauley , dalai 20\\/04\\/200412 00 16 PM Parsons has climbed up to 30 - definitely in that league .\nLindblade has climbed up to grade 31 !\nJames 20\\/04\\/200412 32 49 PM of course ... don t know why I missed those .\nnmonteith 20\\/04\\/200412 35 30 PM Greg Child has climbed grade 29\\/30 routes plus numerous himalyan 8000m and big wall routes .\nWM 20\\/04\\/200412 55 31 PM I can t argue with Keiran that Mentz \\/ Tempest have chopped and changed grades willy nilly - in both directions Necrophiliac , Bostok being other examples .\nBut thats a different issue - they are taking an \\* identical \\* set of technical\\/sustained\\/seriousness factors and saying previous guide s simply added them up wrong .\nFor Bygone and its new FH the equation is now \\* different \\* .\nIts the example chosen by Shepherd - and more illustrative than your hypothetical 23s Hex !\nAs for whether a FH is worth 2 grades in this instance I d say hell yeah .\nIt was a death lead without , now its a lovely jaunt with .\nThe grade value given to this change has to be an average of climbers - so its always going to be approximate too much for bolder climbers that must be you Hex , you big hard man you , not enough for Hex s more ons .\nBut E grades aren t any more exact .\nHex my dear - do you agree with James that the problem is with the \\* implementation \\* of the Ewbank system ?\nIf so a whole new system isn t the solution - proper use of the existing system is ... BTW , the E grade system does not apply to sport routes the poms switch to French grades on their sport crags so Sandinista and Weaveworld would still end up with non-comparable grades ... whats to be gained ?\nEnough ranting ... whoever you are Hexy , you sure have a lot of time on your hands - just doing my best to keep up ... hex - TROLL 20\\/04\\/20046 05 17 PM Stop ranting start chanting !!!\nhex - TROLL 21\\/04\\/200412 08 30 PM On 19\\/04\\/2004 hex - TROLL wrote -RRB- The Ewbank system takes into consideration THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TECHNICAL -RRB- CRUX OF A CLIMB ; A 30m , grade 23 with bolts every metre is the same -RRB- as a 30m , grade 23 requiring tricky route-finding well-spaced RP placements .\n-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- It is that sameness which drives the retro-bolting pressure , mainly -RRB- from the sport faction , as they try to rationalise\\/deny their reality -RRB- of Why can I send 27 on draws and yet freak-out approaching 22 , when -RRB- I have to start thinking about all those other considerations ... stuff -RRB- it !!\n! -- just whack a few more bolts in , so more ons people can enjoy -RRB- the climb .\nYank chillin like a villian Cranker 26 sport 18 trad gfdonc Spread of grades ; what does everyone else think ?\nExcessive bolt-dependency might have something to do with it ...
