Bevan Koopman , University of Queensland , Australia ; and Jane Sledge , Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian , USA Abstract Indigenous communities are beginning to realize the potential benefits digital technologies can offer with regard to the documentation and preservation of their histories and cultures .\nHowever , they are also coming to understand the opportunities for knowledge misuse and misappropriation of their knowledge which may accompany digitization .\nIn this paper we describe a set of open source software tools designed to enable indigenous communities to protect unique cultural knowledge and materials preserved through digitization .\nThe software tools described here enable authorized members of communities to define and control the rights , accessibility and reuse of their digital resources ; uphold traditional laws pertaining to secret\\/sacred knowledge or objects ; prevent the misuse of indigenous heritage in culturally inappropriate or insensitive ways ; ensure proper attribution to the traditional owners ; and enable indigenous communities to describe their resources in their own words .\nHopefully the deployment of such tools will contribute to the self-determination and empowerment of indigenous communities through the revitalization of their cultures and knowledge which colonization , western laws , western cultures and globalization have eroded .\nKeywords Indigenous Knowledge , Cultural Rights , Rights Management Software Introduction Using multimedia technologies , indigenous groups have been able to record and preserve significant aspects of their cultures including languages First Voices , ceremonies , dances , songs , stories , symbols , design , artwork , tools , costumes , historical photographs , film , videos and audio tapes NMAI , Barani , Diwurruwurru .\nDocumentation of indigenous knowledge and history has become an extremely important tool to ensure the survival and self-sustainability of indigenous tribes and cultures , and to provide evidence of past injustices and to support claims of original ownership .\nAlthough digitization is ideal for sharing , exchanging , educating and preserving indigenous cultures , it also creates ample opportunities for illicit access to and misuse of traditional knowledge .\nIt is essential that traditional owners be able to define and control the rights and access to their resources , in order to uphold traditional laws ; prevent the misuse of indigenous heritage in culturally inappropriate or insensitive ways ; and receive proper compensation for their cultural and intellectual property .\nFinally , it is essential that indigenous communities be able to describe and contextualize their culturally and historically significant collections in their own words and from their own perspectives .\nIn this paper we have investigated the application of IT security mechanisms to the rights management of indigenous collections .\nIn consultation with staff from the NMAI Cultural Resources Centre National Museum , we have developed a set of low cost , simple-to-use and robust software tools designed to enable the description , annotation and rights management of collections of mixed-media digital and physical objects belonging to indigenous communities .\nWe have also developed a search , retrieval and presentation interface which retrieves different result sets , depending on the user s profile , and aggregates the results automatically into coherent multimedia SMIL Synchronized presentations .\nBecause of the enormous diversity of indigenous cultures , the system has been designed so that it can easily be customized to support the unique requirements of specific communities .\nThe immediate future involves working closely with a small number of indigenous communities to refine the software to suit their specific requirements and projects .\nEventually we hope to make the software downloadable from the Internet and freely available to indigenous communities for non-profit use and to provide training in its use and maintenance .\nBackground and Requirements The work described here began with an investigation of the ability of current and evolving information technology tools for rights management e.g. , frameworks , markup languages , metadata models and standards to support the unique needs of indigenous communities .\nWe found that initiatives such as MPEG-21 Multimedia Delivery Framework MPEG-21 and Xr ML Xr ML are primarily concerned with e-commerce and protecting the commercial rights of content owners .\nThey are built on the premise of modern intellectual property law regimes and the notions of individual property ownership for a limited duration , ideas which are alien and detrimental to indigenous cultures .\nMPEG-21 and Xr ML do not support the specific requirements expressed by indigenous communities who need to protect indigenous knowledge or enforce tribal customary laws .\nIn an earlier paper Hunter , specific extensions to Xr ML , in the form of customary constraints were developed to support the description of customary or traditional laws which commonly affect access .\nAn analysis of tribal laws across Aboriginal and Native American communities revealed the following common factors or variables which may determine access to traditional knowledge native\\/non-native restrictions ; the user s membership in a particular clan or tribe ; the user s status within the tribe e.g. , elder , initiate , child ; the user s role within the tribe e.g. , dancer , artist , midwife , healer ; the user s gender male , female ; o moon menstrual cycle restrictions ; o pregnancy restrictions ; the relationship of the viewer\\/user to the people , animals or objects depicted in the resource ; the death of people recorded in a resource ; human remains access restrictions - no access should be provided to images of human remains , or specifics about the disposition of human remains repatriated to tribal communities ; the context in which the resource will be reused or reproduced .\nStaff at the NMAI CRC also expressed the need to be able to document traditional care information associated with culturally significant physical artefacts in their custody .\nKristina Dunman has described the meaning and importance of traditional care of American Indian artefacts in Dunman .\nJim Pepper Henry Repatriation Program Manager at the NMAI also provided the following list of traditional care constraints frequently requested by American Indian tribal representatives regarding the storage and handling of objects directional orientation ; segregation from other objects or other tribes materials ; storage on higher shelves , use of wooden shelving ; cover from view with cloth or muslin ; ceremonial feeding\\/dusting with corn pollen and\\/or other materials ; cleansing with smoke cedar , sage , tobacco , sweetgrass etc. .\n; freezing restriction ; low oxygen restriction no CO2 bubble or covering with plastic or other non permeable materials ; sacred\\/ceremonial bundle dis-assemblage restriction bundle to remain intact and unopened ; ceremonial pipe assemblage restriction bowl and stem should be housed disconnected .\nSimilar traditional care recommendations also apply to culturally sensitive artefacts belonging to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communitiesbut held in museums , archives , cultural centres and keeping places .\nThe software should also enable the traditional owners to describe , contextualize and annotate resources in their own words , their own languages and from their own perspectives .\nThe importance and value associated with enabling spoken annotations in addition to textual annotations was multi-faceted Spoken annotation tools reinforce and support the oral tradition which is so strong in many indigenous cultures ; Spoken annotations are an easier and more natural interface for user input than keyboards , particularly for communities with low computer literacy and poor keyboard skills ; Spoken annotations represent new language resources which can be used to help preserve threatened languages ; Photos and videos can act as a trigger for the Indigenous elders to record their stories as spoken annotations to the visual resources .\nIn addition , users should be able to view or listen to associated annotations which are clearly attributed to individuals .\nThis approach supports the unambiguous documentation of all views\\/perspectives - even if they are different or contradictory .\nThe software explicitly displays who said what and when rather than displaying only the view of a Museum Curator which may have been deduced from a number of different sources of varying reliability .\nFigure 1 below illustrates how we envisage the software being used to assist with the protection , preservation and repatriation of indigenous knowledge and artefacts which are being shared , exchanged or returned from museums , archives , private anthropologists collections and cultural institutions back to their original owners .\nN. B.\nWe are not considering the repatriation of human remains within the scope of this project .\nNo single approach is applicable to the repatriation of indigenous information , knowledge and\\/or artefacts .\nFor example , Australian law differs from US law , and additionally , each tribal community will have its own unique needs and requests .\nIn the United States , while the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act NAGPRA specifies the types of objects and sites to be protected and\\/or repatriated , it is expected that some tribal communities will want access to the records of all objects in museum collections associated with their community and be satisfied with digital surrogates and access to physical objects when requested .\nGoing beyond the requirements of NAGPRA , the NMAI has established a Culturally Sensitive Collections Care Program to respond to areas of concern of Native peoples with regard to the maintenance , presentation , and disposition of sensitive materials and information in the collections of the museum .\nJim Pepper Henry , Assistant Director for Community Services at NMAI says This Program is to be implemented with regard to the wishes and concerns of indigenous communities and traditional leaders and structured within the boundaries of the obvious and reasonable limitations of the institution .\nThe basis for this program is formed through consultations with official tribal representatives , tribal elders and traditional leaders , and museum staff with respect to museum policies and procedures , and US federal legislation including the National Museum of the American Indian Act , American Indian Religious Freedom Act AIRFA , Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act NAGPRA , and the Collections Policy of the National Museum of the American Indian .\nThe Program Committee is cognizant of the fact that it is operating within the constraints of a national museum , and acknowledges that in some instances , dependant upon the beliefs and feelings of the Native community concerned , the proposed implementation of sensitive collections care practices within the museum setting may be deemed inappropriate or presumptuous .\nIn such circumstances , the Committee will endeavor to abide by any alternative direction offered by the concerned Native group .\nThe aim of the software described here is to support such a Program .\nFigure 1 Envisaged Software Usage Scenario The envisaged usage and application of the software as described above , introduced certain requirements and design constraints which needed to be satisfied .\nThese included Security mechanisms - because of the sacred\\/secret nature of the content with which we are dealing , it is essential that the IT security mechanisms which are employed be impenetrable and reliable ; Simple user interfaces - many of the potential users of this system will have low computer literacy , so simple intuitive user-friendly interfaces are essential ; Robustness - the system must be able to stand up to the rigors of unexpected input by users with little prior computing experience ; Low cost - in order to make the software open source and accessible to indigenous and grassroots communities , it must be built as inexpensively as possible , using tools which are ideally free ; Interoperability - the software tools should be built on international standards - Dublin Core Dublin , CIDOC CRM CIDOC , MPEG-21 MGEP-21 , Xr ML Xr ML - in order to ensure maximum interoperability between disparate databases ; Portability - it should be able to run on a range of platforms and operating systems .\nJava JDBC , JSP , XML and SMIL have been used as the software development environment to ensure transparent portability across platforms ; Flexibility - The customary laws and intellectual property needs of traditional knowledge holders vary enormously among indigenous communities throughout the world .\nQuite often the views within a single clan can vary significantly , and they may also vary over time .\nOur system attempts to support the common notions associated with traditional laws within Indigenous communities .\nIn addition , we have provided Schema editing tools in order to provide maximum flexibility and to enable easy customization of the software .\nScalability - the size of indigenous collections particularly within cultural institutions can reach hundreds of thousands of items .\nThe software should be capable of efficiently enabling metadata\\/constraints to be applied across large sets of resources , individual resources or regions\\/segments within resources for either individual users or user-groups .\nAlthough a number of other projects have investigated the application of information technology tools to the protection and management of indigenous collections according to customary laws Ara , Sullivan , Digital , Special , they have not approached the problem using international metadata standards nor developed generic yet flexible systems which are capable of supporting indigenous communities globally , but easily customized to support the particular local customs .\nThe remainder of this paper describes the software which has been developed to support the requirements specified above .\nh1 class = Sub Header -RRB- System Architecture and Components This section describes the architecture of the software system , its separate components and the overall process\\/workflow described in Figure 1 .\nThe system consists of three major components The Metadata Editor \\/ Generator ; The Database ; The Search , Retrieval and Presentation Interface .\nFigure 2 illustrates the interfaces to these components and the technologies used to build them and integrate them into a single coherent system .\nFigure 2 System Architecture and Workflow The Metadata Editor \\/ Generator This component of the system enables users to input the descriptive , rights and tribal care metadata associated with the objects either physical or digital and to attach spoken or written annotations to specific objects .\nUsers require a login ID and password to run this software component and , depending on their privileges\\/user profile , may only be permitted access to certain functionality .\nFigure 3 illustrates the three types of metadata which can be input and the users\\/groups who we envisage will provide them .\nFigure 3 - Metadata Types and Sources The Descriptive Metadata consists of Dublin Core Dublin plus some additional optional elements from the CIDOC CRM CIDOC for describing physical museum objects , such as material , technique and dimensions .\nFigure 4 shows the user interface for inputting or editing descriptive metadata .\nAlternatively , some or all of the descriptive metadata could be acquired from existing museum\\/library\\/archive database cataloguing information .\nFigure 4 - Descriptive Metadata Input The Rights Metadata will be provided by the traditional owners or elders of the indigenous community to whom the resource belongs .\nOnly those users with the required access privileges will be able to input or edit the rights metadata .\nSupport has been provided to enable the definition and application of restrictions based on the user s membership of a particular clan or tribe ; the user s status within the tribe ; the user s role within the tribe ; the user s gender ; the relationship of the user to people , animals or objects depicted in the resource ; the death of people recorded in a resource ; the context in which the resource will be reused or reproduced .\nFigures 5a , 5b , 5c , 5d , and 5e show the user interface for defining access restrictions which depend on the user s tribal affiliation , gender , role and status .\nFigure 5 - User Interfaces for Restricting Access According to Customary Laws In addition to the descriptive and rights metadata , annotation tools which enable indigenous communities to describe resources in their own words have been provided .\nAuthorized users can input , record and attach either textual or spoken annotations to specific objects or resources .\nThe ability to enter spoken annotations is especially useful and valuable - it provides a natural user interface which supports the oral tradition and allows users to express their stories in their own words and languages .\nIt also acts as a trigger for generating new knowledge and enhancing existing knowledge .\nFigure 6 , below , illustrates the annotation interface .\nUsers can also browse the list of clearly attributed annotations and view\\/listen to who said what and when about a particular resource .\nFigure 6 Spoken Annotation Input In response to a request from both museum staff and representatives of Indigenous communities , we have also added support for the specification of Tribal Care recommendations .\nThe Tribal Care metadata tool enables Indigenous communities to define the ways in which culturally significant or sensitive physical artefacts should be treated - ways which are acceptable to the cultures represented .\nElders are able to define particular spatial orientation , storage and preservation recommendations to ensure the respectful tribal care of physical artefacts .\nWhile the actual implementation of traditional care specifications may be difficult , many museums are attempting to integrate Indigenous beliefs and requests into museum practices , and our software will hopefully facilitate this process .\nFigure 7 - Tribal Care Specifications Where possible , the specified access restrictions will be enforced by matching them against the profile of the user .\nEvery user of the system requires a login ID and password .\nWhen being allocated a user ID , users will also need to provide supporting documentation to prove their claims of tribal affiliation , status , etc. .\nThe User Manager software component illustrated in Figure 8 allows the systems administrator to add or remove users and to edit their profiles .\nAuthorized elders will be able to enter the rights constraints , and authorized users will be able to attach annotations .\nHence the software affects not only what resources users can access and view but also what metadata tools they can access and hence what metadata they can enter .\nFigure 8 - User Manager Because of the enormous diversity of indigenous cultures , the system has been designed so that it can easily be customized to support the unique requirements of different communities .\nCustomization is carried out through the Schema Manager tool .\nCommunity elders can add new constraints , or remove or refine existing constraints , depending on the traditional laws of their community .\nAn XML Schema XML is saved to reflect their particular metadata requirements and rights constraints , and the user interface is then generated from the saved\\/selected schema .\nFigure 9 illustrates the Schema Manager user interface .\nFigure 9 - Schema Manager The Database Saved metadata is stored in relational tables in a My SQL database which is connected through a JDBC Java Database Connectivity API Java .\nIt is envisaged that , because of the sensitivity of the data , this database will not be accessible through the Internet .\nIt will be stored on CD - ROM or the hard disk of a stand-alone supervised workstation , within a cultural center , keeping place or supervised building such as a library or a school within the community .\nIn addition to the metadata which is explicitly saved to the database through the user interface , meta-metadata is also recorded - all changes to the metadata , who was responsible , and the date\\/time of the changes are recorded within the database .\nThis represents an important component of the system s built-in security framework .\nThe Search , Retrieval and Presentation Interface A search , browse and retrieval interface to the collection was built using standard Web Browser technologies Internet Explorer , Netscape for the user interface .\nThe advantages of using standard Browsers for the search interface are their familiarity and widespread availability and the lack of re-engineering necessary should collections eventually be disseminated over wider networks .\nTo access the collection , users must have been allocated a login ID and password and a user profile .\nThe steps below illustrate the typical procedure which users would follow when searching and browsing an indigenous collection A user logs onto the system using a secure password .\nAssociated with each user is an authenticated user profile which includes information such as tribal\\/western names , native\\/non-native heritage , tribal\\/clan membership , gender , status , role , etc. .\n; The user performs a search on a particular topic , e.g. , dance ; See Figure 10 ; The software then searches the title , subject , and description metadata associated with each object in the collection , for the specified search term e.g. , dance ; For those objects whose metadata matches the search term , the software compares the objects rights constraints with the user s profile to determine whether or not the user is permitted to access this object .\nIf so then this object will be added to the result set ; The list of results\\/objects which match the search term and which the user is permitted to access is then displayed - along with any rights constraints , which appear as icons see Figure 11 ; The user can click on individual objects to view\\/play the object and to view the metadata details and any annotations ; The users can select objects of particular interest and add them to a personal collection ; The software automatically aggregates those mixed-media objects selected by the user images , audio clips , video clips , text , and dynamically generates a SMIL Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language Simulated presentation which is delivered to the user see Figure 12 ; Figure 10 - Search Interface Figure 11 - Search Results Figure 12 - Multimedia Presentation of Results Future Work and Conclusions In this paper we have described a software system developed as a result of consultation with representatives from Indigenous communities and staff from museums , archives , libraries and cultural centres in both Australia and North America .\nHowever at this stage the software remains relatively untested within real world applications or real communities .\nHence the immediate future involves working closely with a small number of indigenous communities to determine whether the software can satisfy the unique requirements of particular Indigenous communities for the management of their culturally sensitive collections or whether further extensions\\/refinements\\/modifications will be required ; whether the dynamic political , social and trust issues e.g. , lack of agreement on access rules , validation of individual claims of authority , authorizations within a tribe or community are greater than the technical problems associated with enforcing them ; the proper procedures required to enable the successful and beneficial application of the software to the preservation , description , protection and annotation of indigenous cultural collections by the traditional owners ; the types of scenarios , situations , collections and communities to which the software is most suited and of maximum benefit ; whether additional security mechanisms such as XML Encryption XML Encryption , XML Digital Signatures XML Digital , SAML Security Assertion Markup Language Security , SSL Secure Sockets Layer Secure Socket and watermarking techniques , would be applicable and could be trusted to ensure secure access to and transfer of sacred\\/secret data over networks between distributed remote locations and a common centralized repository .\nGiven a positive response from the community trials , we plan to make the software freely available and downloadable from the Internet for non-profit use by indigenous communities and to provide training in the usage , refinement and maintenance of the system to interested groups .\nAcknowledgements The work described in this paper has been carried out as part of a Queensland Smithsonian fellowship , funded by the Queensland Government and a collaboration between the Distributed Systems Technology Centre and the Smithsonian s National Museum of the American Indian Cultural Resources Centre NMAI CRC .\nThanks also to Angelina Russo and students from UQ s Information Environments program for their Web search interface design .\nReferences Ara Irititja Archival Project , South Australia , http \\/ \\/ waru.org\\/arairititja\\/ Barani -

'Engineering Management Program Mrs. Jane Hunter Lecturer Advisor While a pursuing a BS in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Arizona , Mrs. Hunter obtained a co-op with IBM in 1981 .\nThe co-op placed her in the technology development of high-speed , institutional size printers and process integration where she continued to work after graduation .\nIn this position , she was assigned to work with other mechanical , electrical , and materials engineers in the department on the project .\nShe then moved into IBM s magnetic storage devices sector where she was responsible for head-tape interfaces .\nShe worked on the early phases of making sure that the low cost print head worked on media under all sorts of conditions in high control studies .\nMrs. Hunter was then presented with an opportunity to move into a management position , which she accepted .\nAt this stage , IBM was getting ready to put their print heads into production .\nMrs. Hunter was assigned to manage the department responsible for testing the prototype .\nFeeling that she was lacking in the area of understanding the business end of her job , she enrolled in a newly developed distance learning program offering a Masters of Engineering Management at the National Technological University NTU .\nNTU at the time was only satellite transmitting courses from Universities to corporate sites , so she was able to earn her MS in Engineering Management while working at IBM .\nSeveral years later she transferred to sales within IBM to Madison , Wisconsin in 1987 as a marketing representative .\nIn Madison , IBM put her through extensive training to sell-midrange systems to well developed companies .\nOne in particular was Anequest , a manufacturer of anesthetics .\nThey were losing their manager of their information technology function so they offered her the position and she accepted .\nAt Anequest her department was responsible for supporting their business systems , interfacing with manufacturing systems , and the sales division .\nAfter working there for several years , she relocated back to Tucson where she setup a consulting firm called the Software Tutor , which taught individuals and small companies how to effectively use their computer applications .\nAt this point she decided to teach after her experiences with Software Tutor along with teaching being one of her aspirations .\nShe accepted a position at Pima Community College where she taught Engineering 102 .\nAt the time UA was short on staff , so Dr. Hal S. Tharp , the associate department head for the UA Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering , asked her to come teach Engineering 102 as an adjunct for the Department .\nWhile teaching Engineering 102 , Mrs. Hunter was informed about a newly developed degree in Engineering Management at UA so she decided to look into it .\nTo her surprise , Dr. Geiger told her she was the only one the department with a MS in EMG .\nAt the time , the course requirements in marketing weren t meeting the needs of the department .\nMrs. Hunter worked with Dr. Geiger on coming up with a proposal for a technical marketing course .\nSoon after , Technical Sales Marketing SIE 415 was established and she has been teaching it ever since .\nA year ago Mrs. Hunter started working on her Ph. .\nD. in Education directed toward the college level .\nShe plans to do her dissertation in Engineering Education where there are numerous opportunities to research its effectiveness .\nBack Email Webmaster The University of Arizona Arizona Board of Regents All Rights Reserved\nEngineering Management Program - Jane Hunter\n',015

but no single ontology or metadata model exists for describing museum multimedia content .\nThis paper describes an approach which combines the domain-specific aspects of MPEG-7 and CIDOC - CRM models into a single ontology for describing and managing multimedia in museums .\nThe result is an extensible model which could lead to a common search interface and the open exchange , sharing and integration of heterogeneous multimedia resources distributed across cultural institutions .\nKeywords Multimedia , Metadata , Interoperability , MPEG-7 , CIDOC - CRM 1 .\nIntroduction Multimedia provides museums with a rich paradigm for capturing , communicating and preserving cultural information .\nIt offers new capabilities for structuring , interpreting and communicating knowledge , and the significance of artifacts within museum collections through the use of digital video , audio , images , graphics and animation .\nMaking collections available in digital form , both in-house and through networks , provides museums with a tremendous opportunity to meet their educational mandate .\nWhen linked together over networks , museum multimedia databases become even more valuable as cross-cultural resources for educational and research purposes .\nIn addition , the potential to re-use multimedia content to create new intellectual property , has further accelerated the growth in the size and number of institutional multimedia databases .\nExisting multimedia objects are being combined and reused to generate complex , interactive multimedia , hypermedia , virtual reality displays and participatory exhibitions .\nThis has led to a demand for systems and tools which can satisfy the more sophisticated requirements for storing , managing , searching , accessing , retrieving , sharing and tracking complex multimedia resources .\nMetadata is the value-added information which documents the administrative , descriptive , preservation , technical and usage history and characteristics associated with resources .\nIt provides the underlying foundation upon which digital asset management systems rely to provide fast , precise access to relevant resources across networks and between organizations .\nThe metadata associated with multimedia objects is infinitely more complex than simple metadata for resource discovery of simple atomic textual documents and the problems and costs asssociated with generating such metadata are correspondingly magnified .\nMetadata standards enable interoperability between systems and organizations so that information can be exchanged and shared .\nStandardized metadata models have been developed to describe museum objects CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model CIDOC Conceptual and to describe multimedia content MPEG-7 ICS but no standards currently exist for specifically describing museum multimedia content .\nHence the key goal of this project is to analyze and evaluate each of these existing standards and to determine a way to merge the two ontologies to generate a standardized model for describing museum multimedia content .\nSuch a model , which is capable of supporting the exchange of information between existing collection management systems for physical artefacts and emerging digital asset management systems would enable knowledge and resources to be shared , re-used and exchanged to a much greater extent than is currently possible both within and between museums .\nHence in the remainder of this paper we describe both the CIDOC \\/ CRM and MPEG-7 metadata models .\nWe then analyze them both to determine the overlaps , intersections and differences .\nBased on this analysis we hope to be able to determine how the models can best be merged to combine the two domain-specific vocabularies of MPEG-7 and CIDOC \\/ CRM , without introducing semantic inconsistencies or redundancies .\nThe final outcome is in essence , a single , machine-understandable , extensible ontology designed to support the description and management of multimedia resources within museums .\n2 .\nThe Nature of Multimedia in Museums 2.1 Types of Multimedia in Museums Audiovisual or multimedia content within museums is highly diverse and varies widely in origin , genre , purpose , media type , format , quality , age , context and the reason for its cultural significance or retention within a museum or collection .\nMultimedia in museums can include everything from disintegrating maps on paper to full feature films on DVD .\nWithin the scope of this paper we are referring to images , audio , video , multimedia , graphics and animation - in both analog and digital form .\nTable 1 below provides an overview of the typical constitution of multimedia collections within a museum Table 1 Overview of Museum Multimedia Types In most cases , it is the semantic content , which is depicted or recorded on the multimedia resource which is of value i.e. , the resource records an event , place , person , object or concept which is of cultural , historical , geographic or educational importance .\nFor some multimedia resources , the cultural or historical significance lies with the medium or recording technology e.g. , the earliest photographs , film , video and audio recordings .\nIn some cases , the multimedia object is valuable because of the person who captured or recorded it e.g. , home movie collection of John F. Kennedy or because it is part of a larger collection or bequest or it is exemplary of a particular genre , era or technique .\nIn many cases , both the semantic content and the context , agents , technique and medium are all of importance and need to be Often multimedia content has been generated for preservation and dissemination purposes .\nThe multimedia resource may be a digital surrogate of the original culturally significant museum artifact which is too valuable or fragile to be handled or is inaccessible for reasons of location .\nIn many situations , the multimedia resources are created as an alternative visual representation image , model of a physical museum artifact or as a replacement for earlier analog and digital formats which are becoming obsolescent .\nHence in addition to the typical bibliographic information , the metadata for multimedia resources may need to describe detailed formatting information , structural or segmentation information temporal , spatial and spatio-temporal segments , semantic information description of the objects\\/people\\/places \\/ events which are recorded and the event history and rights information .\nA detailed description of the metadata requirements for multimedia in museums is provided in the next section .\n2.2 The Metadata Requirements for Multimedia in Museums The metadata associated with multimedia resources can be classified into a number of different categories Bibliographic metadata - this includes information about the resource s creation\\/production date , place and the individuals or organizations involved e.g. , producer , director , and cast and the resource s classification information e.g. , title , abstract , subject , and genre .\nFormatting metadata - this includes information about the format , encoding , storage and system requirements associated with the resource .\nTable 2 below shows the formatting metadata typically recorded for different media types .\nTable 2 Typical Format Metadata for Different Media Types Structural metadata - this provides information about the structural decomposition of the multimedia resource into spatial , temporal or spatio-temporal segments scenes , shots , frames , image regions and the relationships between these segments .\nContent metadata - this provides indexes to the actual content which is recorded or depicted within the multimedia resource .\nContent metadata can vary from natural language descriptions of the people , objects , places or events which are depicted to the low level audio or visual features such as color histograms or volume .\nEvents and rights metadata - this is information describing the life history of the resource .\nIt includes everything from acquisition and relocation events to the reformatting , editing , repackaging and distribution events to the metadata attribution events to the usage , copyright agreements , and permission events .\nA number of projects have developed or are developing metadata models for multimedia in museums Gabriel , 2001 ; The TOKEN 2000 or for historical audiovisual collections The ECHO .\nThese projects are either developing their own application-specific data models and vocabularies , or choosing one of the existing standards MPEG-7 or CIDOC \\/ CRM .\nNone have considered the approach of merging ontologies from the museum domain and the multimedia domain into a single ontology .\n2.3 A Typical Example Consider the following example which is typical of multimedia content held by museums or archives a film owned by the Museum of Victoria which contains unedited footage of Australian Aboriginal tribal ceremonies filmed by anthropologist Baldwin Spencer between 1901 and 1912 .\nBelow is the catalogue item from Screen Sound Australia s online catalogue .\nIn 1999 , the original film was copied to digital format MPEG-1 by the National Film and Sound Archive for the purpose of preservation .\nExample 1 In Sections 3.2 and 4.2 below we compare the abilities of the CIDOC CRM and MPEG-7 to describe museum multimedia , by describing this example using their domain-specific vocabularies .\n3 .\nThe CIDOC \\/ CRM 3.1 Overview of the CIDOC CRM The CIDOC object-oriented Conceptual Reference Model CRM , was developed by the ICOM \\/ CIDOC Documentation Standards Group to provide an ontology for cultural heritage information .\nIts primary role is to serve as a basis for mediation of cultural heritage information and thereby provide the semantic glue needed to enable wide area information exchange and the integration of heterogenous resources between cultural institutions .\nThe CIDOC CRM is presented as an object-oriented extensible data model , expressed in RDF Schema RDF Schema Spec 2000 .\nFigure 1 illustrates the class hierarchy for the CIDOC CRM , as generated by the SIS knowledge base ICS .\nThe detailed specification of the CIDOC CRM Version 3.2 which includes detailed descriptions of the class and property definitions , hierarchies and relationships , is available from Crofts , 2002 .\nFigure 1 - The CIDOC \\/ CRM Class Hierarchy In order to understand and evaluate the CIDOC CRM s ability to describe multimedia resources , we apply it to the example in Section 2.3 .\n3.2 A CIDOC CRM Description of the Example Example 2 Together with an analysis of the class and property hierarchies provided by the CIDOC CRM , this exercise reveals that the CIDOC CRM s strengths lie in its ability to describe Identification information ; Acquisition and ownership information ; Physical movement , location and relocation information ; Physical attributes and features - dimensions , marks , visual items , material , sections , physical location etc. .\n; Historical events - CIDOC CRM supports rich semantic descriptions of concepts or events - both real world events , as well as the events which occur in the life cycle of a resource , and those events which are depicted in the visual information objects .\nHowever the CIDOC CRM is limited in its ability to describe digital objects and particularly digital multimedia or audiovisual content .\nThe following requirements are inadequately supported Formatting attributes encoding , storage , system requirements for digital images , audio , video , text and multimedia such as those shown in Table 1 are not currently supported ; It is possible to define sections of physical objects using spatial measurements or coordinates and the temporal location of Events or Periods using the Date and Time Span entities - but not temporal , spatial or spatio-temporal locations within non-physical digital media ; Physical features can be described but not visual or audio features such as color histograms , regions , shape , texture , volume etc. .\n; Hierarchical or sequential summaries of audiovisual content which specify keyframes , scene changes or key videoclips , are not supported The CIDOC CRM provides the is_documented_in property to record the relationship of a culturally significant physical or real-world artefact or event to its visual\\/audio\\/audiovisual recording , which is classed as a Document .\nHowever there is no explicit support for the different media types in CIDOC \\/ CRM .\nBecause the CIDOC CRM is designed to provide an extensible underlying framework , it may be possible to improve support for multimedia descriptions , through the addition of MPEG-7 multimedia-specific sub-classes and sub-properties to existing CIDOC \\/ CRM superclasses and super-properties .\nWe investigate this approach in Section 5 .\n4 .\nMPEG-7 - the Multimedia Content Description Interface 4.1 An Overview of MPEG-7 The Moving Pictures Expert Group MPEG , a working group of ISO \\/ IEC , is expected to shortly release the final standard for MPEG-7 MPEG-7 Overview , the Multimedia Content Description Interface , a standard for describing multimedia content .\nThe goal of this standard is to provide a rich set of standardized tools to enable both humans and machines to generate and understand audiovisual descriptions which can be used to enable fast efficient retrieval from digital archives pull applications as well as filtering of streamed audiovisual broadcasts on the Internet push applications .\nMPEG-7 can describe audiovisual information regardless of storage , coding , display , transmission , medium , or technology .\nIt addresses a wide variety of media types including still pictures , graphics , 3 D models , audio , speech , video , and combinations of these e.g. , multimedia presentations .\nMPEG-7 provides a core set of Descriptors Ds that can be used to describe the various features of multimedia content ; pre-defined structures of Descriptors and their relationships , called Description Schemes DSs .\nInitially MPEG-7 definitions description schemes and descriptors were expressed solely in XML Schema 9-11 .\nXML Schema proved ideal for expressing the syntax , structural , cardinality and datatyping constraints required by MPEG-7 .\nHowever semantic interoperability is necessary to enable systems to exchange data e.g. , metadata descriptions , to understand the precise meaning of that data and to translate or integrate data across systems or from different metadata vocabularies .\nHence it was recognized that there was a need to formally define the semantics of MPEG-7 terms ; and to express these definitions in a machine understandable , interoperable language .\nRDF Schema RDF Schema Spec 2000 was the obvious choice due to its ability to express semantics and semantic relationships through class and property hierarchies and its endorsement by the W3 C s Semantic Web Activity W3 C .\nConsequently the Adhoc Group for MPEG-7 Semantic Interoperability was established and an MPEG-7 ontology was developed and expressed in RDF Schema and DAML + OIL extensions Hunter Adding , Hunter An ROF 2001 .\nThe extensions provided by DAML + OIL DAML + OIL were necessary to satisfy certain requirements such as the need for multiple ranges and sub-class specific constraints .\nThe basic class hierarchy of MPEG-7 content and segments is shown in Figure 2 below e.g. , the MPEG-7 class Video Segment is a subclass of both Video and Segment .\nFigure 2 - MPEG-7 Multimedia Segment Class Hierarchy The relationships of the Segment types to other segment types and multimedia entities are dependent on the allowed types of decomposition .\nMultimedia resources can be segmented or decomposed into sub-segments through 4 types of decomposition Spatial Decomposition - e.g. , spatial regions within an image ; Temporal Decomposition - e.g. , temporal video segments within a video ; Spatiotemporal Decomposition - e.g. , moving regions within a video ; or by Media Source Decomposition - e.g. , the different tracks within an audio file or the different media objects within a SMIL presentation Associated with each of the subclasses in Figure 2 are various properties which define permitted relationships between the segment classes corresponding to specific structural or organizational description schemes and the permitted audio , visual and audiovisual attributes associated with different types of multimedia segments .\nThe visual and audio features which may be associated with multimedia and segment classes are listed in Table 3 .\nAssociated with each of the visual and audio features is a choice of descriptors , also illustrated in Table 3 .\nPrecise details of the structure and semantics of these descriptors are provided in ISO \\/ IEC 15938-3 FCD Multimedia Content Description Interface - Part 3 Visual and ISO \\/ IEC 15938-3 FCD Multimedia Content Description Interface - Part 4 Audio 1so , 2001 .\nTable 3 - MPEG-7 Visual and Audio Features and their Corresponding Descriptors Only particular visual and audio descriptors are applicable to each segment type .\nTable 4 below illustrates the association of visual and audio descriptors to different segment types .\nThe MPEG-7 RDF Schema Hunter , Adding ; Hunter , An ROF specifies the constraints on these property-to-entity relationships .\nTable 4 - Relationships between Segment Types and Audio and Visual Descriptors descriptors , MPEG-7 provides standardized Description Schemes which combine the base classes and properties above , into pre-defined structured relationships ISO -5 , 2001 .\nFigure 3 provides an overview of the organization of MPEG-7 Multimedia DSs into the following areas Basic Elements , Content Description , Content Management , Content Organization , Navigation and Access , and User Interaction .\nFigure 3 - Overview of MPEG-7 Multimedia DSs ISO \\/ IEC These different MPEG-7 DSs enable descriptions of multimedia content which cover Information describing the creation and production processes of the content director , title , short feature movie ; Information related to the usage of the content copyright pointers , usage history , broadcast schedule ; Media information of the storage features of the content storage format , encoding ; Structural information on spatial , temporal or spatio-temporal components of the content scene cuts , segmentation in regions , region motion tracking ; Information about low level features in the content colors , textures , sound timbres , melody description ; Conceptual , semantic information of the reality captured by the content objects and events , interactions among objects ; Information about how to browse the content in an efficient way summaries , views , variations , spatial and frequency sub-bands ; Organization information about collections of objects and models which allow multimedia content to be characterized on the basis of probabilities , statistics and examples ; Information about the interaction of the user with the content user preferences , usage history .\nIn the next section we generate an MPEG-7 description of the example in Section 2.3 , which illustrates the use of the Creation Information DS , the Media Information DS and the Temporal Decomposition DS , to provide meaningful structure to the metadata description .\n4.2 An MPEG-7 Description of the Example Example 3 is an MPEG-7 description of the example in Section 2.3 .\n5 .\nComparison of the CIDOC \\/ CRM and MPEG-7 Ontologies 5.1 Overlaps , Intersections and Differences A comparison of the MPEG-7 and CIDOC CRM ontologies and their descriptions of the same resource above , reveals the following Both metadata models are capable of describing the creation , production and classification information associated with a resource .\nMappings between these components of the two models is possible ; The CIDOC CRM is more focussed on describing physical museum artefacts and real world events from an epistemiological perspective .\nCIDOC CRM provides an ontology which allows the decomposition of knowledge available in data records into atomic propositions that are context free , interpretable when stand-alone but can easily be compiled into an integrated knowledge base ; MPEG-7 is more focused on precise , fine-grained content-based descriptions of multimedia content , particularly digital multimedia , to enable the automated search and retrieval or filtering and retrieval of relevant multimedia content using standardized descriptions ; Because the CIDOC CRM vocabulary is based on a hierarchical object-oriented model in which Events and Activities are core entities , it provides a better underlying framework for recording the events , changing attributes and dynamic relationships associated with a resource .\n5.2 Merging the Ontologies Since CIDOC CRM is designed to provide a top level set of classes and properties which can act as attachment points for domain-specific metadata ontologies , it makes sense to use the CIDOC CRM as the foundation and to extend it with MPEG-7 specific components , to add multimedia metadata capabilities .\nThe obvious attachment point for the MPEG-7 class hierarchy is the CIDOC CRM Document class , as shown in Figure 4 below .\nFigure 4 - Extending the CIDOC CRM Class Hierarchy with MPEG-7 Multimedia Subclasses click for a detailed image The CIDOC CRM provides an is_composed_of property which can be extended through RDF Schema sub-properties to define the structural or segmentation metadata associated with multimedia resources .\nSpatial , temporal , spatio-temporal and media-source decompositions are all provided through this approach , as illustrated in Figure 5 .\nFigure 5 - Adding MPEG-7 Segmentation properties to CIDOC - CRM The CIDOC CRM Time - Span and Place classes need to be sub-classed to enable Media Time and Media Place classes to be defined - these are required in order to specify temporal , spatial and spatio-temporal locators within audiovisual resources .\nFurther extensions to the CIDOC CRM which are required for adequate multimedia description include the provision of formatting properties Table 2 and visual and audio features\\/descriptors Table 3 , associated with multimedia and segment entities .\nSome formatting metadata can be accommodated by the existing Dimension class e.g. , file size , frame dimensions .\nBut formatting information such as encoding and storage medium could be attached through a new Format class and a new has_format property , similar to the existing Dimension class e.g. , Example 4 Audio and visual descriptors could be provided through the provision of two new classes , Visual Feature and Audio Feature .\nTheir respective MPEG-7 descriptors as outlined in Table 3 could be defined as sub-classes .\nThe properties has_visual_feature and has_audio_feature would be required to associate these new classes\\/sub-classes to the relevant Multimedia Document types , as specified in Table 4 .\nBased on the proposals described here , an RDF Schema representation of the MPEG-7 extensions to the CIDOC CRM , has been developed and is available RDF Schema Rep .\n6 .\nConclusions and Future Work 6.1 Conclusions In this paper we have analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the CIDOC CRM and MPEG-7 ontologies in the context of providing a metadata model for describing and managing museum multimedia resources .\nBased on this analysis , we have described an approach to merging the two models by using the CIDOC CRM as the underlying foundation and extending it through the addition of MPEG-7-specific sub-classes and sub-properties to provide support for multimedia concepts and descriptions .\nThe outcome is a single machine-understandable ontology in RDF Schema which can be used to provide the underlying model for describing multimedia in museums and thus facilitate the exchange , sharing and integration of heterogeneous multimedia information between cultural institutions .\n6.2 Future Work Having developed the model , the next step is to test , evaluate and refine it by applying it to the description and management of real collections of multimedia resources within museums .\nWe plan to do this through the development of a test-bed using resources provided by the Smithsonian s National Museum of the American Indian CRC .\nIn 2001 , two workshops were held by the DELOS Working Group on Ontology Harmonization Doerr to discuss and compare the CIDOC CRM and ABC ontologies Lagaozi , Hunter , 2001 .\nBoth of these ontologies have been designed to facilitate semantic interoperability between metadata vocabularies from different domains .\nA third workshop is planned for June 2002 , and the anticipated outcome will be a common merged model .\nAssuming that this eventuates , then future work will involve determining how the multimedia specific concepts of MPEG-7 can be attached to or accommodated within this merged ontology .\nAcknowledgements The work described in this paper has been carried out as part of a Smithsonian Fellowship funded by the Queensland Government and the Smithsonian Institute .\nAdditional funding has been provided by the Cooperative Research Centre for Enterprise Distributed Systems Technology DSTC through the Australian Federal Government s CRC Programme Department of Industry , Science and Resources .\nThanks also to the other members of the DELOS Working Group on Ontology Harmonization , and especially Martin Doerr , both for Figure 1 , and for his patient and detailed explanations of the CIDOC CRM .\nReferences CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model , http \\/ \\/ cidoc . ics . forth . gr \\/ Crofts , N.

'D - Lib Magazine September 1999 Volume 5 Number 9 ISSN 1082-9873 MPEG-7 Behind the Scenes Jane Hunter Distributed Systems Technology Centre University of Queensland jane@dstc.edu.au Abstract The purpose of this article is to provide a better understanding of the objectives and components of the MPEG-7 , Multimedia Content Description Interface standard , an overview of the current state of its development and an idea of its expected impact on digital libraries of the future .\nIntroduction It s clearly much more fun to develop multimedia content than to index it .\nThe amount of multimedia content available -- in digital archives , on the World Wide Web , in broadcast data streams and in personal and professional databases -- is growing out of control .\nBut this enthusiasm has led to increasing difficulties in accessing , identifying and managing such resources due to their volume and complexity and a lack of adequate indexing standards .\nThe large number of recently-funded DLI-2 projects related to the resource discovery of different media types , including music , speech , video and images , indicates an acknowledgement of this problem and the importance of this field of research for digital libraries .\n1 MPEG-7 2 is being developed by the Moving Pictures Expert Group MPEG 3 , a working group of ISO \\/ IEC .\nUnlike the preceding MPEG standards MPEG-1 , MPEG-2 , MPEG-4 which have mainly addressed coded representation of audio-visual content , MPEG-7 focuses on representing information about the content , not the content itself .\nThe goal of the MPEG-7 standard , formally called the Multimedia Content Description Interface , is to provide a rich set of standardized tools to describe multimedia content .\nA single standard which can provide a simple , flexible , interoperable solution to the problems of indexing , searching and retrieving multimedia resources will be extremely valuable and widely deployed .\nResources described using such a standard will acquire enhanced value .\nCompliant hardware and software tools capable of efficiently generating and interpreting such standardized descriptions will be in great demand .\nBut will MPEG-7 be able to deliver such a standard -- one which satisfies its formidable goals and widely heterogeneous scope whilst concurrently providing simplicity , flexibility , interoperability and usability ?\nObjectives MPEG-7 aims to standardize a core set of Descriptors Ds that can be used to describe the various features of multimedia content ; pre-defined structures of Descriptors and their relationships , called Description Schemes DSs ; a language to define Description Schemes and Descriptors , called the Description Definition Language DDL ; coded representations of descriptions to enable efficient storage and fast access .\nMPEG-7 descriptions a set of instantiated Description Schemes will need to be linked to the content itself to allow fast and efficient searching for material of a user s interest .\nThe descriptions may be physically located with the associated AV material , in the same data stream , on the same storage system , or the descriptions could be stored remotely .\nHence mechanisms that can link the AV material to their MPEG-7 descriptions and vice versa , regardless of where the content and its descriptions are located , are required .\nScope and Applications MPEG-7 4 is intended to describe audiovisual information regardless of storage , coding , display , transmission , medium , or technology .\nIt will address a wide variety of media types including still pictures , graphics , 3 D models , audio , speech , video , and combinations of these e.g. , multimedia presentations .\nExamples of MPEG-7 data are an MPEG-4 stream , a video tape , a CD containing music , sound or speech , a picture printed on paper , or an interactive multimedia installation on the web .\nMPEG-7 will address both retrieval from digital archives pull applications as well as filtering of streamed audiovisual broadcasts on the Internet push applications .\nIt will operate in both real-time and non real-time environments .\nA real-time environment in this context means that the description is generated at the same time as the content is being captured e.g. , smart cameras and scanners .\nThere are many applications and application domains which will potentially benefit from the MPEG-7 standard .\nExamples of applications include Digital libraries image catalogue , speech archive ; Broadcast media selection radio channel , TV channel ; Multimedia editing personalised electronic news service , media authoring .\nThe potential applications cover a wide range of domains which include Education ; Journalism e.g. , searching speeches of a certain politician using his name , his voice or his face ; Cultural services museums , art galleries ; Film , Video and Radio archives ; Entertainment e.g. , video-on-demand , searching a game , karaoke ; Investigation services surveillance , human characteristics recognition , forensics ; Geographical information systems ; Remote sensing cartography , ecology , natural resources management ; Telemedicine and bio-medical applications .\nWork Plan Between October 1996 and October 1998 , the scope , objectives and requirements for MPEG-7 were defined .\nThe end of this stage was marked by an open Call for Proposals Cf P in October 1998 , which asked for submissions of relevant technologies fitting the requirements 5 .\nIn answer to the Cf P , some 60 parties submitted , in total , almost 400 proposals .\nThe proposals were evaluated at the MPEG-7 Test and Evaluation Meeting in Lancaster in February 1999 , according to their ability to satisfy the requirements .\nCertain proposals and elements of proposals were selected to be incorporated into the current collaborative phase .\nParticipants involved in making and evaluating submissions and the ongoing development of MPEG-7 include broadcasters , electronics manufacturers , content creators and managers , publishers and intellectual property rights managers , telecommunication service providers and academic researchers .\nDuring the current collaborative phase , selected elements of various proposals are incorporated into a common model the e Xperimentation Model , or XM .\nThe goal is to build the best possible model , which is in essence a draft of the standard .\nThe XM is updated and improved in an iterative fashion until MPEG-7 reaches the Committee Draft CD stage , after several versions of the Working Draft .\nImprovements to the XM are made through Core Experiments CEs .\nCEs are defined to test the existing tools against new contributions and proposals , within the framework of the XM , according to well-defined test conditions and criteria .\nFinally , those parts of the XM or of the Working Draft that correspond to the normative elements of MPEG-7 will be standardized .\nTable 1 illustrates the work plan .\nCall For Proposals October 1998 Evaluation February 1998 First Version of Working Draft December 1998 Committee Draft October 2000 Final Committee Draft February 2001 Draft International Standard July 2001 International Standard September 2001 Table 1 .\nScheduled Work Plan Current State of the Descriptors A Descriptor D defines the syntax and the semantics of one representation of a particular feature of audiovisual content .\nA feature is a distinctive characteristic of the data which is of significance to a user .\nFor example , the color of an image is a feature .\nPossible Descriptors corresponding to the color feature are color histogram , RGB vector or a string .\nA Descriptor value is an instantiation of a Descriptor for a given data set .\nFor example , RGB = 255 , 255 , 255 , colorstring = red .\nTable 2 illustrates some of the current descriptors which have been incorporated into the XM or are undergoing core experiments CEs .\nThey have been subdivided into Visual and Audio descriptors .\nType Feature Descriptors Visual Basic Structures Grid layout Histogram Color Color space Dominant color Color histogram Color quantization Texture Spatial image intensity distribution Homogeneous texture Shape Object bounding box Region-based shape Contour-based shape 3 D shape descriptor Motion Camera motion Object motion trajectory Parametric object motion Motion activity Motion trajectory featurese . g. , speed , direction , acceleration Audio Speech Annotation Lattice of words and phonemesplus metadata Timbre Ratio of even to odd harmonics Harmonic attack coherence Melody Melodic contour and rhythm Table 2 .\nOverview of Current Descriptors Each descriptor is defined by normative and non-normative parts .\nThe normative parts consist of the descriptor s syntax , semantics and binary representations of these .\nThe optional , non-normative parts are the recommended extraction and similarity matching methods 6 .\nMany low-level features can be extracted from the content in fully automatic ways e.g. , color histogram .\nRecommended feature extraction algorithms are included in the non-normative parts of some descriptors .\nTo allow for industry competition and to take advantage of expected improvements in technology , they are not a mandatory part of the standard .\nThe same approach applies to similarity-based querying of descriptor values in which results are ranked in order of degree of similarity with the query .\nA recommended similarity matching method may be specified within a descriptor s non-normative component but it is not required for interoperability .\nSome of the open issues regarding descriptors include Is it possible to standardize certain descriptors e.g. , Timbre without also standardizing the extraction and similarity matching methods ?\nHow can one compare the performance of descriptors with overlapping functionality in the CEs ?\nHow can one link procedural code e.g. , the extraction and similarity matching methods to the description ?\nHow can one define complex composite descriptors such as parameterized arrays in the DDL ?\nWhen does a composite descriptor become a description scheme ?\nCurrent State of the Description Schemes A Description Scheme DS specifies the structure and semantics of the relationships between its components , which may be both Descriptors and Description Schemes .\nThe following concepts are used within the DS group to describe audiovisual content Syntactic structure - the physical and logical structure of audiovisual content , e.g. , structures based on temporal segments and\\/or spatial regions .\nSemantic structure - breakdown based on semantic meaning , e.g. , structures based on temporal events and\\/or spatial objects .\nSyntactic-semantic links - the associations between syntactic elements and semantic elements .\nThe Generic Audiovisual DS 7 represents the integration of all of the DS proposals and submissions within a single DS .\nAt the top level it consists of A collection of Syntactic structure DSs , i.e. , physical features such as segments , regions , color , texture , and motion are described here ; A collection of Semantic structure DSs , i.e. , semantic features such as objects , actors or events , e.g. , goal , advertisement , Madonna ; Syntactic-semantic links DSs - which relate the syntactic elements to the semantic elements ; Summary DS - this is used to enable browsing at different levels of granularity ; Meta Info DS - this contains descriptors carrying author or publisher-generated information , e.g. , Content DS , Credits DS , Creation Purpose DS , Rights DS , Publication DS , Rights DS ; Media Info DS - this contains descriptors related to the storage media , e.g. , file format , system , medium , color , sound , length , duration , compression format ; Model DS - this provides a way to describe the classification methods for audiovisual data or the correspondence between the current audiovisual content and other content through different models ; Figure 1 below illustrates the structure and content of the Generic Audiovisual DS .\nFigure 1 .\nThe Generic Audiovisual Description Scheme One of the major problems with the DS work is the size and complexity of the Generic Audiovisual DS .\nThere is a certain amount of redundancy and overlapping functionality between the different DS proposals which have been included .\nSome of the DS proposals which have been integrated are extremely complex and of dubious applicability .\nUnless a library of basic simple DSs is provided , many potential users who want simple bi-level multimedia metadata structures will find the MPEG-7 standard simply too bewildering or intimidating to use .\nCurrent State of the Description Definition Language The Description Definition Language DDL is the language that allows the creation of new Description Schemes and Descriptors .\nIt also allows the extension and modification of existing Description Schemes .\nThe DDL has to be able to express spatial , temporal , structural , and conceptual relationships between the elements of a DS , and between DSs .\nIt must provide a rich model for links and references between one or more descriptions and the data that it describes .\nIt also has to be capable of validating descriptor data types , both primitive integer , text , date , time and composite histograms , enumerated types .\nIn addition , it must be platform and application independent and human - and machine-readable .\nThe general consensus within MPEG-7 is that it should be based on XML syntax .\nOf the ten DDL submissions which responded to the Cf P in February , one was based on the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language SMIL , three were based on XML DTDs , three were based on XML DTDs with extensions such as data typing and inheritance , two were based on the Resource Description Framework RDF and one proposal was based on Open Knowledge Base Connectivity OKBC 8 .\nAfter evaluating the DDL proposals , the recommendation was that -- although none of the proposals satisfied all of the requirements , the proposal from DSTC 9 provided the best starting point for further DDL development .\nHowever , it was also recommended that the DDL group should track the work of the W3 C -- in particular , the XML Schema Working Group and the XLink , XPath and XPointer Working Groups .\nIn May this year , the XML Schema WG produced a 2-part working draft of the XML Schema language XML Schema Part 1 Structures 10 and XML Schema Part 2 Datatypes 11 .\nDiscussions and preliminary encoding of the Generic Audiovisual DS led the DDL group to the decision to use XML Schema language as the basis for the DDL .\nHowever , certain reservations were raised at the Vancouver MPEG meeting in July concerning this approach .\nThe major concerns were MPEG-7 s dependency on the output and time schedule of W3 C XML Schema WG ; Restricted access to internal documents associated with XML Schema development ; The effect of W3 C s copyright of XML Schema language on the ability to add MPEG-7-specific extensions .\nAs a result of these concerns , further discussions at the Vancouver meeting led to the decision to develop an MPEG-7-specific language in parallel with the XML Schema development being carried out within W3 C 12 .\nA new grammar based on DSTC s proposal , but using MPEG-7 terminology Description Schemes and Descriptors and with modifications to ensure simple mapping to XML Schema , was recently developed .\nBased on this grammar , the following tasks are currently being performed Specification of the BNF and an XML DTD for the new grammar ; Specification of the validation mechanisms which must be provided by a parser ; Development of a validating parser for this DDL Relationship To Other Standards MPEG-7 is aware of , and taking into account , the activities of a number of other standards groups during the development process .\nFor the archival descriptions , library e.g. , MARC , Z39 .50 and archive e.g. , EBU \\/ SMPTE , ISAD G , EAD , Dublin Core , CEN \\/ ISSS MMI standards are being taken into account .\nWhilst for the streaming descriptions , the broadcast Electronic Programme Guides EPGs e.g. , DVB , ATSC and web channels Channel Definition Format CDF standards are being considered .\nFor the intellectual property and rights management descriptions , a liaison has been formed with the INDECS project .\nThe DDL group has been closely monitoring the work of the W3 C s XML Schema Working Group and the XLink , XPath and XPointer Working Groups .\nThe MPEG-7 community is attempting to combine efforts with these groups through liaisons .\nThis will hopefully maximize interoperability , prevent duplication of work and take advantage of work already done through the use of shared common ontologies , description schemes and languages .\nMPEG-7 hopes to act as a gateway or container for older established standards whilst at the same time providing a reference standard which can be used by proprietary multimedia applications or specific multimedia domains .\nMPEG-7 Related Projects There are undoubtedly a large number of MPEG-7-related projects being undertaken within commercial enterprises , particularly broadcasting and digital imaging companies , which involve the adoption of MPEG-7 conformance .\nThe details of most of these projects are confidential .\nHowever , details are available for a number of collaborative government-funded research projects being undertaken , three of which are described below .\nThe HARMONY Project HARMONY is a three-way International Digital Libraries Initiative project between Cornell University , the Distributed Systems Technology Centre and the University of Bristol s Institute for Learning and Research Technology .\nIts objective is to develop a framework to deal with the challenge of describing networked collections of highly complex and mixed-media digital objects .\nThe research will draw together work on the RDF , XML , Dublin Core , MPEG-7 and INDECS standards , and will focus on the problem of allowing multiple communities of expertise e.g. , library , education , rights management to define overlapping descriptive vocabularies for annotating multimedia content 13 .\nThe DICEMAN Project DICEMAN is an EC-funded project between Teltec Ireland DCU , CSELT Italy , IBM Germany , INA France , IST Portugal , KPN Research Netherlands , Riverland Britain and UPC Spain .\nIts broad objective is to provide an end-to-end chain for indexing , storage , search and trading of digital AV content .\nThe technical work will focus on MPEG-7 indexing through a COntent Provider s Application COPA ; the use of FIPA Agents to search and locate the best content ; and support for electronic commerce and rights management 14 .\nThe A4 SM Project - A Framework for Distributed Digital Video Production The A4 SM project which is based at GMD s IPSI Integrated Publication and Information Systems Institute is currently researching the application of IT support to all stages of the video production process .\nThe purpose is to seamlessly integrate an IT support framework into the production process , i.e. , pre-production e.g. , script development , story boarding , etc. .\n, production e.g. , collection of media-data by using an MPEG-2 \\/ 7 camera , etc. .\n, and the post-production support of non-linear editing .\nIn collaboration with tv-reporters , cameramen and editors they have designed an MPEG-7 camera in combination with a mobile annotation device for the reporter , and a mobile editing suite suitable for the generation of news-clips .\n15 Future Expectations MPEG-7 is at a crucial stage of its development .\nIn order to achieve wide-spread adoption as the standard for describing multimedia resources , MPEG-7 will have to resolve a number of formidable issues , including both high-level philosophical issues and low-level technical problems .\nSome of the high level issues which need to be resolved include Reconciliation of the opposing approaches of the various communities involved in MPEG-7 development which include the high-level semantic approach of the database\\/digital library community which typically believes that MPEG-7 needs only to provide standardised structure and linking mechanisms to the international community ; the low-level technical approach of the signal processing community which sees success in standardizing specific low level audiovisual features ; the free-spirited creative approach of the artistic content creators who don t like to be constrained or pigeon-holed by technocrats and their rigid rules , tools and best-practice guides .\nStriking the right balance between semantic and structural interoperability , media-specific and community-specific requirements and simplicity , extensibility and flexibility .\nEstablishing and clarifying mutually-beneficial relationships between MPEG-7 and other existing standards bodies , e.g. , W3 C , Dublin Core , SMPTE .\nSome of the low-level technical issues and problems which need to be resolved include Integration of the Descriptor specifications within the Description Schemes ; Refinement and clarification of the Description Schemes .\nExisting redundancies need to be removed before any new submissions are added ; A decision must be made on the DDL , i.e. , a choice between an MPEG-7 specific language or XML Schema language ; Development of a validating parser for the chosen DDL ; Provision of libraries of Descriptors and Description Schemes ; Specification of temporal , spatial , spatio-temporal , conceptual links between descriptions and content ; Enabling of links to procedural code -- extraction and similarity matching algorithms ; Binary encoding of descriptions ; Encoding of descriptions within streaming multimedia .\nAssuming that the MPEG-7 participants do manage to overcome these obstacles , the success of MPEG-7 will then be dependent on the development and availability of hardware and software tools which can efficiently generate , store , search , retrieve and interpret MPEG-7 descriptions .\nReferences 1 Lesk ,

LOCAL NEWS Washington Report , November 1986 , Page 2 Special Report Israeli Arms Sales to Iran By Jane Hunter In September , when the Israeli government radio accused Iranian troops of training Lebanese Shiite guerrillas for attacks on the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army , and said that Iranians themselves might also have been among those who attacked Israeli positions in Lebanon , the US media reported those charges in great detail .\nNone found the time or space , however , to note how ironic it was for Israel to complain about Iranian military activities .\nIran might have been hard put to continue its costly six-year-old war with Iraq not to mention simultaneously stirring up followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini in Lebanon if Israel had not been willing to sell the Khomeini government great quantities of the weapons Iran desperately needed to keep its army in the field .\nThat is only one of the anomalies of Israel s booming arms trade .\nUS law and US policy also come in for some stretching and twisting .\nOver the course of the Gulf war , Iran s quest for weapons has become legendary , with many countries and hordes of private arms dealers eager to conclude arms deals and reap the premium commissions Iran offers .\nIsrael , with standing access to the same models of US-made arms upon which the Shah based Iran s arsenal , and with its desire to build up an indigenous arms industry , has led the pack .\nThe London Observer estimated that Israel s arms sales to Iran total $ 500 million annually .\nBefore 1979 , when Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi held power , Iran was the world s biggest buyer of Israeli arms .\nThe Islamic fundamentalist government which succeeded the Shah militantly damned Zionism up and down and hung a prominent Iranian Jew for spying for Israel .\nIn 1980 , however , when the Iraq - Iran war began , Iranian representatives met in Paris with Israel s deputy defense minister and worked out a Jews for arms deal .\nIran permitted Jews to emigrate and Israel sold Iran ammunition and spare parts for Chieftain tanks and US-made F-4 Phantom aircraft .\nChanneled through a private Israeli arms dealer , this particular agreement appropriately ended in 1984 , when Iran was slow in paying its bills .\nAlthough secrecy is the first principle in the netherworld of arms trading , details of several subsequent major Israeli arms sales to Iran have come to light .\nIn 1981 , Ya acov Nimrodi , an intimate of leaders across the Israeli political spectrum , sold the Iranian defense ministry $ 135,842,000 worth of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles , 155 mm .\nmortars , ammunition , and other weapons through his Tel Aviv-based company , International Desalination Equipment , Ltd. . From 1955 to 1979 Nimrodi had been Israel s military attache in Tehran .\nOn July 24 , 1984 , Radio Luxembourg reported that Nimrodi had met in Zurich with the deputy defense minister and the top intelligence officer of Iran and with Rif at al - Assad , the brother of Syrian President Hafez al - Assad .\nSwiss government sources said that the meeting resulted in a deal to ship 40 truckloads of weapons a day from Israel to Iran , via Syria and Turkey .\nOn September 15 , 1985 , a DC-8 cargo plane returning from Iran and supposedly bound for Malaga , Spain , made an emergency landing in Tel Aviv .\nInvestigation revealed that the plane recently acquired from an obscure Miami firm by a shadowy Brussels-based Nigerian company had been flying Hawk missiles from the US to Iran via Israel .\nA Boeing 707 registered to the company had been carrying loads of 1,250 TOW missiles from Israel to Iran via Malaga .\nAt about the same time the London Observer reported that a ship carrying 25,000 tons of Israeli material was making a rush delivery , sailing directly to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas rather than first going to Zaire where the Iranian buyers would inspect the cargo .\nIn May , 1986 , West German authorities foiled an $ 81 million ammunition deal and uncovered a tank deal in the process .\nCharged in the case were an Israeli and a former Israeli citizen .\nThe West German weekly Stern said a telex from the state-owned Israeli Military Industries dated April 1 indicated official Israeli involvement .\nIn June of this year a Swedish businessman was reported to have acted as intermediary for Israeli sales of explosives to Iran .\nThe shipments went from Israel to Iran via Argentina .\nIn September , 1986 , United Press International reported that the Danish Sailor s Union had logs and records to prove that since May a Danish freighter had taken four 900-ton shipments from the Israeli port of Eilat to Bandar Abbas in Iran .\nThe union was certain the arms were US-made .\nRe-selling without permission arms acquired from the US and the sale of US weapons to Iran are both prohibited by US law .\nIn separate incidents involving sales negotiated within the US , federal authorities have arrested two Israeli military reservists and a Yugoslav - American , Paul Cutter .\nCutter , who has connections to Israeli Minister of Trade and Industry Ariel Sharon , and who also told co-workers he was authorized to sell arms Israel captured in Lebanon in 1982 , has been convicted and jailed .\nThe Israeli government disassociated itself from these men .\nNow , however , a federal sting operation has cracked the biggest arms deal yet .\nUS Customs Service agents drew retired Israeli army general Avraham Bar - Am and 12 co-conspirators three of them Israelis into a carefully-laid trap last April , Tapes made by the Customs Service reveal Israeli government involvement in a $ 2.6 billion conspiracy to sell US-made arms to Iran through third countries .\nOn recordings made available to the Chicago Tribune , Samuel Evans , a London-based American lawyer who coordinated two separate conspiracies to offer sophisticated aircraft , missiles , and ordnance to Iran , is heard to say that he would be discussing the deal with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and that the authority for the transaction went right through to Prime Minister Peres .\nThe case is particularly serious because federal authorities presented evidence in their indictment that the deal included phony re-export certificates attesting that Israel was re-selling surplus arms to Turkey , which is legal , rather than to Iran , which is not .\nGeneral Bar - Am claimed from his jail cell that he had an Israeli government license to sell arms .\nDenying any involvement , Israeli officials insisted that the license was only to prospect for sales , one of a thousand distributed to former military officers .\nThe Israelis have worked hard to bolster this contention .\nIn late September Defense Minister Rabin called a press conference to say the permit process would be changed to avoid the appearance of government approval .\nBut an earlier statement by Ya acov Nimrodi that such sales are government-authorized and that permits come from a special department in the Israeli Defense Ministry and are difficult to get contradicts Rabin as have many reports over the years that it is common Israeli practice to sell arms through fronts and agents .\nThe US government has avoided dealing head-on in public with the Israeli government over this issue .\nWhen the Bermuda conspirators were arrested it was reported that the Israeli ambassador was called in for a stern warning .\nIt is unlikely , however , that prosecutors will focus on the Israeli government s role when the Bermuda conspirators stand trial in New York this November .\nOver the last six years Washington has several times expressed its disapproval of arms sales to Iran .\nDuring the 1979-1981 hostage crisis , Israel was specifically asked to stop deliveries while Iran was holding US hostages and it is possible that Israel complied .\nAt an October I luncheon he hosted , Secretary of State George Shultz assured diplomats from the Arab states of the Gulf that Israel had told US officials it had stopped selling arms to Iran in 1983 .\nShultz , in fact , accused the Soviet Union of not clamping down on sales by its allies to Iran !\nDuring the Reagan administration US policy has swung through various levels of support for Iraq .\nIsrael s often-stated policy on the Gulf war is to keep it going as long as possible because the dreadful carnage ties up the combatants and prevents either from attacking Israel .\nIn 1983 , then - Defense Minister Ariel Sharon blurted out duringa US speaking engagement that Israel sold arms to Iran because it regarded Iraq as the greater enemy , and that the sales had been thoroughly discussed with US officials .\nUS officials acknowledged such discussions but denied that Israel had US permission .\nLast spring what turned out to be an Israeli disinformation campaign propounded the notion that the US had asked Israel to sell arms to Iran .\nThe tapes in the Bar - Am case are said to suggest that the US was considering shifting its support to Iran while the conspiracy-sting was being hatched .\nThis kind of last-ditch Israeli government defense , probably supported by pro- Israel political obscurantists in Washington , has almost certainly been used before .\nWhen it was revealed that Israel was shipping arms to the Soviet-supported government of Ethiopia to fight Western-assisted resistance movements , and arms to the Argentine junta during the Malvinas - Falklands war , Israeli disinformationists in Washington sought to argue that Israeli actions which directly contravened stated US government objectives were really part of a double game somehow coordinated with Washington .\nThis time , arrests by the US government of Israeli players have left no doubt that the US interest is to halt , not abet , Israeli arms sales to America s enemies .\nJane Hunter is the editor and publisher of Israeli Foreign Affairs , P.

he was responsible for providing the Scottish Court with meat and game , a position that the Hunters held throughout the Middle Ages and beyond .\nIn papers relating to the King s Inquisition in 1116 , we find mention of Williemo Venator William the Hunter , 1st Laird who was appointed as Royal Huntsman while his wife had the honor of serving Queen Matilda as lady-in-waiting .\nWilliam put his expertise to good use in the wild forests and fens , then rich with wildlife , which surrounded the site of the timber fortress later to become Hunter s Toun .\nAs recognition of his family s skills the title of Royal Huntsman became a hereditary appointment .\nedit Scottish Wars of Independence The Pele Tower of Hunterston sheltered the Hunters throughout the Wars of Scottish Independence from which the Hunters emerged with their lands intact despite having signed the Ragman Rolls , swearing allegiance to King Edward I of England , in 1269 .\nHaving most likely supported William Wallace and certainly Robert the Bruce , in 1374 the great King s grandson Robert II granted William Huntar 10th Laird a charter for the lands of Ardneil for faithful services rendered .\nThe Family still possess this ancient document .\nFor many years , the Hunters continued to serve the Scottish Crown as Royal Huntsmen and as soldiers , sometimes at great cost .\nedit Anglo - Scottish Wars During the Anglo - Scottish Wars between England and Scotland in the 16th century John Huntar the 14th Chief died with King James at the Battle of Flodden Field and in 1513 Mungo Huntar the 16th chief died for Queen Mary at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 .\nClan chiefs from Clan Colquhoun , Clan Macfarlane and Clan Farquharson also died at this battle .\nA good clan chief was expected to lead by example , which meant being first into battle at the head of the clan .\nFor this reason many clan chiefs died during battle .\nBecause of the awful number of Scottish lives lost at the Battle of Pinkie , the 10th of September is known in Scotland as Black Saturday .\nedit Post Clan Activity As times became more settled the Hunters devoted more time to farming their extensive lands , although they still produced soldiers of distinction over the generations .\nGould Hunter - Weston , husband of Jane Hunter - Weston 26th Laird fought in India at Lucknow in 1857 and their eldest son , Aylmer 27th Laird was a well known general in the First World War .\nHe later became Member of Parliament for North Ayrshire .\nDuring her tenure as Clan Chief , Eleanora 28th Laird fought in the courts , but lost , a compulsory purchase order for land at Hunterston to build a nuclear power station .\nThe last Clan Chief , Neil Hunter of Hunterston and of that Ilk , along with his wife Sonia , Madam Hunter of Hunterston , continued the fight against industrialization .\nHe was well known for his sailing prowess and represented the United Kingdom in two Olympic Games during which he won a silver medal .\nLike many Hunters before him he was in true tradition an expert in archery .\nThe present Clan Chief , Madam Pauline Hunter of Hunterston and of that Ilk and 30th Laird and Chief of Clan Hunter .\nedit Clan Seat Castle The seat of the chief of Clan Hunter has been at Hunterston Castle for over 800 years .\nedit See also Scottish clan Armigerous clan edit External Links http \\/ \\/ www.scotclans.com\\/clans\\/ Hunter\\/history . html This Scottish clan-related article is a stub .\nYou can help Wikipedia by expanding it .\nRetrieved from http \\/ \\/ en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/ Clan _ Hunter Categories Scottish clan stubs | Scottish clans Views Article Discussion Edit this page History Personal tools Sign in \\/ create account Navigation Main Page Community Portal Featured content Current events Recent changes Random article Help Contact Wikipedia Donations Search Toolbox What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Printable version Permanent link Cite this article This page was last modified 23 43 , 30 November 2006 .\nAll text is available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License .\nSee Copyrights for details .\nWikipedia is a registered trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation , Inc. .

'In the last 20 years the province of Marlborough has moved from virtual obscurity to become New Zealand s largest and best-known wine region with a reputation for producing some of the world s finest sauvignon blanc .\nThis huge potential was something that was recognized back in 1983 by Jane Hunter and her late husband Ernie when they founded their first fledgling winery in the picturesque Wairau Valley .\nSince those early years Jane has been owner , viticulturist and managing director of what has become one of New Zealand s most established wineries , Hunter s Wines .\nUnder her expertise , the original vineyard area has increased by 2.5 times its original size and the company s annual output has grown to around 60,000 cases of wine , nearly half of which is exported .\nHunter s Wines have won more than 100 gold medals at national and international wine competitions , including the Marquis de Goulaine Trophy for Best Sauvignon Blanc in the World at the 1992 International Wine Spirit Competition .\nMore recently , the 2001 Sauvignon Blanc received gold medals at both the Hotel Grand Chancellor Royal Hobart Wine Show and at the 2002 Sydney International Wine competition where it was placed in the top 100 wines of the competition .\nThe Hunter s 1999 Chardonnay was also awarded gold in the same international wine competition in Sydney .\nClick below to download a map of the Marlborough Wine Region\nHunters Wines - Hunters Marlborough New Zealand\n',003

'The Jane Hunter story Hunter s Wines has a reputation for consistently producing the highest quality wines year after year , and Jane is the driving force behind its ongoing success .\nNot surprisingly , Jane has been described by the London Sunday Times as the star of New Zealand wine .\nIn 1993 she received an OBE for service to the wine industry , and in 1997 was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Massey University for her outstanding contribution to the industry .\nA fiercely independent , family-owned winery , Hunter s Wines was the combined dream of Ernie and Jane Hunter .\nIt was the inspired foresight of the ever-enthusiastic Ernie , New Zealand s unofficial wine ambassador , which recognized the vast potential of Marlborough as a premier wine-growing region .\nHowever , only five years after producing his first six award winning wines in fact , the first six Hunter s Wines to emerge , he was tragically killed in a motor accident at the age of 37 .\nIn the aftershock of this , Jane , herself a highly qualified viticulturist with a long family history of Australian grape growing , resolved to build on the vineyard s proven potential .\nThrough her strong determination , together with the talents of Chief Winemaker Gary Duke and eminent Australian oenologist Dr Tony Jordan , Hunter s Wines has achieved an enviable reputation both in this country and in the wine capitals of the world .\nThis list of industry accolades is impressive indeed .\nQuality not quantity was Ernie Hunter s catch cry and this philosophy lives on to this day .\nSince 1987 Jane has been owner , viticulturist and managing director of Hunter s Wines .\nDuring that time , the vineyard has expanded to 4 times its original size .\nApproximately 50 \% of this production is exported , particularly to the UK , but also to Switzerland , Ireland , Denmark , Australia , the USA , Canada , Singapore , Hong Kong , Denmark and Brazil .\nJanes s wine beginnings Jane was brought up in South Australian wine country and her father still grows grapes in the Riverland , just north of the famous Barossa Valley .\nAfter a short period studying animal husbandry , Jane changed her specialist area and is now a highly qualified viticulturist , with an Agricultural Science degree from the University of Adelaide .\nJane was initially employed by Montana as national viticulturist , in charge of all Montana vineyards , organising research and development and liaising with managers and contract growers .\nIn 1983 , the late Ernie Hunter and Jane began a fledgling winery near Blenheim using borrowed gear from an old cider factory in Christchurch .\nFour years later , after Ernie s sudden death , Jane took over the management of Hunter s Wines .\nThe winery has continued to grow in size , annual output and reputation .\nTo date , Hunter s Wines has won more than 100 gold medals at wine competitions , including London , Sydney , Hong Kong , Switzerland Australia and New Zealand .\nHunter s Marlborough Garden Hunter s winery features a Marlborough Garden .\nNative trees , shrubs and grasses reflect the original natural flora of the Wairau Valley s Dry Plain .\nA unique tourist attraction in its own right , Hunter s New Zealand native - plant inspired gardens feature rare and interesting New Zealand flora .\nRegular sculpture displays are often held in the gardens .\nThe annual Hunter s Garden Marlborough Festival is now recognized as one of New Zealand s most prestigious and popular annual events .\nSponsored by Jane Hunter since 1993 the event now features a week of garden visits , workshops with international speakers , and a gala fete .\nwww.garden-marlborough.com Hunter s Marlborough Garden Peter Macdonald General Manager Big in stature , somewhat larger than life and with a huge passion for all that he takes on , Peter is committed to the worldwide success of Hunter s Wines .\nBorn , educated and trained in Australia , his quest for knowledge has propelled him from teacher and sportsman , to overseeing marketing and sales operation .\nPeter s role in the management team is pivotal to the exciting future for our wines .\nGary Duke Chief Winemaker Gary s meticulous attention to detail well suits him to the role of internationally recognized winemaker .\nFrom being Assistant Winemaker at Tisdalls Wines in Echuca , Victoria in 1981 , Gary went to earn his Bachelor of Science Oenology then take up the position of Winemaker at Hanging Rock Winery in Macdedon , Victoria .\nThe cool climate there broadened and hardened Gary s winemaking skills - especially in the areas of still white and sparkling wines .\nA fascination with New Zealand attracted Gary to Marlborough where he has confirmed his reputation as one of the country s leading Winemakers .\nAndrew Parley Winemaker Hunter s winemaker , Andrew Parley gained a Master of Applied Science degree in Wine Science at Lincoln University .\nHe started his winemaking in the North Island , at Gisborne and Auckland , before going to the Northern Hemisphere for more experience ; including three vintages in Italy and two in South Africa .\nHowever , the challenge and thrill of producing world class wines brought him back to New Zealand and to Hunter s. When not winemaking , Andrew is most likely to be found with a kayak strapped to his shoulders climbing up one of Marlborough s wild river valleys and enjoying the great outdoors that surrounds the vineyards .\nBryan Vickery Vineyard Manager Bryan Vickery joined Hunter s as Vineyard Manager in 2004 .\nFormerly an orchidist in North Canterbury , Bryan moved to Marlborough where he studied and gained a Diploma in Viticulture and Wine Production .\nBryan looks after the day to day running of the company owned and leased vineyards .\nThis involves supervising harvest , pruning , irrigation and spary programs .\nWith a very stong focus on producing quality grapes , Bryan enjoys the wonderful climate Marlborough offers .\nOutside viticulture Bryan makes the most of the great outdoors of the region .\nAaron Jay Aaron is new to the Hunter s team having joined us earlier this year to assist Bryan with the day to day operation of the vineyards .\nAaron has been working in vineyards around the Marlborough area for the past two years .\nOutside work Aaron has a great passion for sports .\nHunter s artist-in-residence The artist in residence at Hunter s is Clarry Neame .\nClarry works with oils .\nExamples of his work include floral oil pointillism , abstract , landscapes , people , brushwork and palette knife .\nRenowned for evoking emotional responses with his work selected paintings are available for sale at the gallery at Hunter s. Hunter s artist-in-residence Clarry Neame The Crest The crest appearing on the Hunter s wines label is that of the Hunter clan of Scotland .\nThe founder of Hunter s wines , the late Ernie Hunter , secured the rights to use this family crest .\nVisitors to Hunter s Wines initially associated the dog in the logo with Commodore , Ernie Hunter s gigantic but affable St. Bernard .\nThe Hunter s Team Left to right Bryan Vickery Vineyard Manager , Andrew Parley Winemaker , Gary Duke Chief Winemaker , Jane Hunter O.\nB.

Newton .\nReprint of 1880 edition published by Kingman Bros. , Chicago WILLIAM T. HUNTER , ESQ. .\nis of English parentage .\nEngland too is his own native land .\nHe was born April 2 , 1802 , in the shire of Cumber-land .\nEmigrating to America in 1828 , he landed in the city of Boston on August 12 .\nNot yet content , the following summer he passed on to the city of New York , where , after remaining until autumn of 1832 , he returned to England .\nA few pleasant months rolled quickly by , and he was ready to re-embark for American shores .\nHe reached New York during the spring of 1833 , accompanied this time by a number of his fellow countrymen .\nAfter a sojourn of about one more year , he removed to Ann Arbor , Michigan , then quite a tiny village .\nHere residing about 2 years , he married MRS. JANE BUCKINGHAM , and then removed to St. Joseph County of the same State ; this was in 1836 .\nHe here purchased land and began to clear and improve ; but his stay in measure was only temporary , for in 1837 , he removed to Allen County , Indiana , settling in Perry Township , near the present village of Huntertown .\nAnother purchase of wild land was made , and again for a short time , he began the task of subduing the forest .\nA little time , however , and he changed his vocation to that of hotel-keeping .\nAt this too , he was successful , and yet his attention and interests were not exclusively given to private affairs .\nBeing a resolute man and one deprecating villainy and wrong , he became an active member of the association termed the Regulators , during the days of that organization , whose purpose it was to rid Allen and adjoining counties of a troublesome band of horse thieves and counterfeiters .\nIn this work he was very earnest , and did his full share in helping to bring to punishment these enemies of law and good society .\nDuring the gold excitement of 1852 , he went to California , where for 3 years he engaged at mining and other pursuits .\nOn his return , he renewed the pursuit of agriculture , with which , up to the present , he has been more or less connected .\nHe , likewise , has been identified with many enterprises conducive to building up and improving the village of which he is a resident .\nMRS. HUNTER was the daughter of ROBERT AND MARGARET RANNEY , of Sheffield , Berkshire Co. , Mass. , and was born November 24 , 1815 .\nShe emigrated with her parents to Monroe County , New York , in 1830 .\nShe was here married in 1833 to JOHN BUCKINGHAM , by whom she had one child ; being left a widow by his death in 1835 .\nSince becoming the consort of Mr. Hunter , they have been blessed with 7 children , 6 of them still survive , and are engaged at various pursuits .\nMrs. Hunter , ever a sympathizing neighbor , is always ready to assist those in trouble or distress , even to the extent of much inconvenience and injustice to herself .\nShe has proven a most exemplary wife and affectionate mother , whose ceaseless devotion and care seems never to weigh as a burden .\nMr. Hunter , ever conscientious and upright , is always willing to grant to others what he claims for himself honesty of motive , in disagreements or differences of opinion .\nAn obliging neighbor , a fond parent , and doting husband ; with his venerable companion , they are greatly esteemed among their extended circle of friends and acquaintances .\n_____________________________________________________ From B.

HUNTER , whose name is perpetuated in the one village of Perry township , was a native of Cumberland , England , who first came to America in 1828 , and in 1837 settled in Perry , on the Lima Road .\nHe began clearing a farm at the same time but con-ducted a tavern at his home .\nThe site of Huntertown was a natural gathering place for settlers homes , as it was the only spot not covered with forest .\nThe Opening as it was called , was not made by the settlers , nor for them .\nHowever , they gladly availed themselves of it , setting up their temporary cabins and camps there while they cleared more permanent sites for home building .\n_____________________________________________________ WILLIAM TODD HUNTER , born April 9 , 1802 in Cumberland , England or April 2 Died January 10 , 1887 Married JANE RANNEY BUCKINGHAM , born Nov. 16 , 1815 in Sheffield , Berkshire Co , MA Died November 24 , 1885 Their Children NANCY ELIZABETH HUNTER , 1849-1930 JOSEPH HUNTER , 1836 WILLIAM S.

HUNTER and SIDNEY HUNTER .\nThen in the Hunter Family Tree given to the HHS at a later date , we find also WILLIAM CARR HUNTER , with a wife NORA .\nThe 1880 census shows WILLIAM S. HUNTER with wife MARY G. , who is Mary Geraldine De Long and she has been given to SIDNEY HUNTER , by the old genealogy .\nAlso that same genealogy gives two children to Sidney and Mary , ZELLA and BERYL .\nSo do we have two Williams ??\nOr is William S. , William Sidney or Sidney William ??\nWILLIAM CARR HUNTER seems to have different children , CLARA and GUY .\nHowever in the older papers we have we find that Clara and Guy were the children of Joseph .\nIs William Carr Hunter a son of Joseph also ??\nCan anyone out there give us the straight of this family ?\nAt the present , I am assuming that William S. Hunter is Sidney and that William Carr Hunter is another brother as they have different families .\n_____________________________________________________________________ Additions to the generations are The latest Hunter Family Tree information we have gives this interesting tale of the name HUNTER .\nIt says that William s real name was Toddhunter and thinking it was too long , he had it changed legally to Todd Hunter .\nAnd that his brother was Joseph Hunter .\nJOSEPH HUNTER Married MELINDA called Harriet Melinda on cem .\nrecords And they had 4 children MOLLIE , called Big Mollie Mary Ann ORPHA Ophulia ED WILLIE Mollie married a MR.\nBRIGHT and later a MR.

'A Comparison of Schemas for Video Metadata Representation Jane Hunter , CITEC , 317 Edward St Brisbane , Qld , 4001 , Australia .\nPhone +617 33654310 , Fax +617 33654311 jane@dstc.edu.au Liz Armstrong , DSTC , Level 7 , GP South , Uni of Qld , Qld , 4072 , Australia .\nPhone +617 33654310 , Fax +617 33654311 liz@dstc.edu.au Abstract To enable the resource discovery of audiovisual documents over the WWW , it will be necessary to define content description standards or metadata standards for complex , multi-layered , time-dependent information-rich audiovisual data streams .\nIn particular , this is the primary goal of the emerging MPEG-7 standard , the Multimedia Content Description Interface 1 , under development by the MPEG group .\nIn the past , a lot of effort has gone into generating descriptors and description schemes for video indexing but comparatively little research has been done on schemas capable of defining the structure , content and semantics of video documents and enabling validation and higher levels of automated content checking .\nThis paper compares the capabilities of the RDF Schema , Extensible Markup Language XML Document Type Definitions DTD s , Document Content Description DCD and Schema for Object - Oriented XML SOX , for supporting and validating hierarchical video descriptions based on Dublin Core , MPEG-7 and a specific hierarchical structure .\nFinally this paper proposes a hybrid schema based on features from each of these schemas which will satisfy the MPEG-7 Description Definition Language DDL requirements .\nKeywords Video , Metadata , Schema , Dublin Core , MPEG-7 1 .\nIntroduction To enable the resource discovery of audiovisual documents over the WWW , it will be necessary to define content description standards or metadata standards for complex , multi-layered , time-dependent information-rich data streams .\nIn particular , this is the primary goal of the developing MPEG-7 standard , the Multimedia Content Description Interface 1 , under development by the MPEG group .\nA number of papers have considered the application of Dublin Core DC and the Resource Description Framework RDF to video indexing 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 .\nAn example of such an application is described briefly below .\nHowever , very little work has been done on defining schemas which are capable of actually validating and constraining video descriptions and their associated data models .\nSuch schemas will be necessary for the development of cost-efficient , user-friendly , semi-automatic metadata generation and editing tools for video .\nSuch a schema would also provide a solution for the Description Definition Language DDL component of the MPEG7 requirements .\nThis paper first briefly presents a video description scheme based on Dublin Core and MPEG-7 .\nFrom this description format , a list of schema requirements are generated .\nIt then compares the ability of a number of existing schemas and schema proposals , including the RDF Schema , XML DTDs , DCD and SOX , to satisfy descriptions of hierarchical video structures .\nExamples of schema definitions are given to illustrate their capabilities .\nFinally this paper proposes a hybrid schema based on specific features from each of these schemas and schema proposals which would satisfy the MPEG-7 Description Definition Language DDL requirements .\n2 .\nProposed Video Description Scheme Dublin Core was designed specifically for generating metadata to facilitate the resource discovery of textual documents .\nAlthough a number of workshops have been held to discuss the applicability of Dublin Core to non-textual documents such as images , sound and moving images , they have primarily focused on extensions to the 15 core elements through the use of subelements and schemes specific to audiovisual data , to describe bibliographic-type information rather than the actual content .\nIt has been shown 2 that it is possible to describe both the structure and fine-grained details of video content by using the fifteen Dublin Core elements plus qualifiers and encoding this within RDF .\nThis pure Dublin Core approach provides multiple levels of descriptive information .\nAt the top level the 15 basic Dublin Core elements can be used to describe the bibliographic type information about the complete document e.g.\nTitle , Author , Contributor , Date etc. .\n.\nThis enables non-specialist inter-disciplinary searching , independent of media type .\nExtensions or qualifiers to specific DC elements Type , Description , Relation , Coverage can be applied at the lower levels scenes , shots , frames to provide fine-grained , discipline - and media-specific searching e.g.\nDescription .\nCamera .\nAngle .\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that the semantic refinement of Dublin Core through the use of qualifiers eventually leads to a loss of semantic interoperability .\nThe alternative is a hybrid approach in which RDF or some other framework is used to combine both simple unqualified Dublin Core and MPEG-7 descriptors within a single description container .\nDublin Core can be used for generic media-independent search and retrieval while MPEG-7 can be used for object-specific fine-grained queries .\nOur future research will compare and evaluate these two approaches for multimedia resource discovery and determine the best balance between semantic interoperability , extensibility and modularity .\nAt this stage , we don t know the specific attributes of each level , we can only assume that each structural component will possess both a set of Dublin Core attributes plus a set of MPEG-7 attributes , as illustrated in Figure 1 below .\nFor example , if DC .\nType = Image .\nMoving .\nTV .\nNews .\nScene then valid descriptors will include both the DC simple elements plus MPEG-7 descriptors such as script , transcript , editlist , keyframe etc. .\nIf DC .\nType = Image .\nMoving .\nTV .\nNews .\nScene .\nShot then valid descriptors will include both the DC elements plus keyframe , camera_distance , camera_angle , camera_motion , opening_transition , closing_transition .\nIf DC .\nType = Image .\nMoving .\nTV .\nNews .\nScene .\nShot .\nFrame then a valid descriptors will be the DC elements plus colour_histogram .\nFigure 1 shows the logical structure , the structural components and their associated Dublin Core attributes and some assumed MPEG-7 attributes for the proposed video description scheme .\nFigure 1 Multilayered Hierarchical Structure and Attributes of Video 3 .\nVideo Metadata Schema Requirements In order to represent the video structure and Dublin Core descriptors outlined in Figure 1 , a suitable schema must be able to support the following Hierarchical structure definitions .\nThe schema must be able to constrain the structure to a precise hierarchy in which complete video documents sit at the top level .\nThese in turn contain sequences , which contain scenes , which contain shots , which contain frames , which contain objects or actors .\nFigure 1 illustrates this hierarchy .\nEach level or class within the hierarchy must be constrained to possess only specific attributes .\nIn our description scheme , we assume that each layer possesses the 15 simple , optional and extensible DC elements plus a set of class-specific attributes unique to that layer .\nThese represent the set of MPEG-7 descriptors for that class when they become available .\nElement and attribute inheritance .\nIt should be possible to specify sub-classing with inheritance of attributes and elements from the upper to lower classes .\nIn addition , sub-classes should be able to have their own additional attributes and elements .\nThis allows efficient reuse and customization of document schemas .\nData Typing .\nIt must be possible to constrain the values of attributes to certain data types .\nData types supported should include primitive data types as well as Schemes e.g.\nSMPTE , enumerated data types , controlled vocabularies , file types images , URIs and complex data types e.g. color histograms , 3 D vectors , graphs , RGB values etc. .\n.\nIt should also be possible to specify multiple alternative schemes or data types for a particular attribute .\nCardinality within attributes should be representable .\nIt must be possible to specify that an attribute can have zero , one or multiple values .\nIdeally the minimum and maximum number of attributes should also be specifiable e.g.\na scene must contain between 2 and 5 shots .\nSpatio-temporal specifications .\nThe Schema must be able to support the specification of temporal characteristics e.g.\nbegin and end time of segments and their duration .\nSimilarly , it should be able to support spatial representation e.g.\nregions within an image or motion along a line .\nSpatial , temporal and conceptual relations .\nSpatial relations such as neighbouring objects and temporal relations such as sequential or parallel segments should be supported .\nGiven such a relationship between two classes , it should also be possible to constrain specific attribute values of these classes .\nFor example , the start and end times of scenes contained within a sequence , must lie within the start and end time of that sequence .\nHuman-readability .\nIt is desirable rather than mandatory that both the schema and the description output from the schema should be human-readable .\nAvailability of supporting technologies such as parsers capable of validating input descriptions , databases and query languages .\nThese requirements are similar and compatible with the DDL requirements listed in section 4.1.1 of the MPEG-7 Requirements Document 7 .\n4 .\nResource Description Framework RDF Schema The Resource Description Framework RDF enables interoperability between applications which exchange machine-understandable information on the Web .\nA model for representing metadata as well as a syntax for encoding RDF , based on XML has been defined in the RDF Model and Syntax Specification document 8 .\nRDF is based on a resource and property data model system .\nA collection of classes typically authored for a specific purpose or domain and the definition of their properties attributes and corresponding semantics represent an RDF schema .\nA schema defines not only the properties of the resource or class Title , Author , Subject , Size , Color etc. .\nbut also may define the kinds of resources being described books , webpages , people , companies , etc. .\n.\nThe details of RDF schemas have been defined in the RDF Schema Specification document 9 .\nClasses are organized in a hierarchy , and offer extensibility through subclass refinement .\nThis way , in order to create a schema slightly different from an existing one , one can just provide incremental modifications to the base schema .\nThrough the sharability of schemas RDF will support the reusability of metadata definitions .\nDue to RDF s incremental extensibility , agents processing metadata will be able to trace the origins of schemes they are unfamiliar with back to known schemes , and perform meaningful actions on metadata they weren t originally designed to process .\nThe sharability and extensibility of RDF also allows metadata authors to use multiple inheritance to mix definitions , to provide multiple views to their data , taking advantage of work done by others .\nThe XML namespace mechanism serves to identify different RDF Schemas .\nRDF schemas can be compared to XML Document Type Descriptions DTDs .\nUnlike an XML DTD , which gives specific constraints on the syntactical structure of a document , an RDF schema provides semantical information about the interpretation of the statements given in an RDF data model .\nGiven its goals , RDF appears to be the ideal approach for supporting descriptors from multiple description schemes simultaneously , as required by the MPEG-7 DDL .\n4.1 Example of a Suitable RDF Schema This section describes an RDF schema definition that attempts to map to the diagram in Figure 1 and support the requirements listed above .\nSince we want the DC simple attributes to be applicable to every component or layer , videos , sequences , scenes , shots , frames and objects are all sub-classes of a top level document class which possesses the DC attributes .\nIn addition each sub-class has its own additional descriptive properties or attributes which will correspond to MPEG-7 descriptors when they become available .\n-LRB- rdf RDF xmlns rdf = http \\/ \\/ www.w3.org \\/ TR \\/ WD-rdf-syntax # xmlns rdfs = http \\/ \\/ www.w3.org \\/ TR \\/ WD-rdf-schema # xmlns dc = http \\/ \\/

sequences which contain shots which contain frames which contain objects and actors .\nIf you create a property contains for #video then how do you also apply it to #sequence , #scene and #shot ?\nSince each property requires a single range , then generic relationships such as contains can not be used .\nInstead , a separate property must be defined for each domain-range pair .\nThis is tedious and repetitive .\nThe lack of class-specific constraints on domain and range of properties is a major limitation of RDF , particularly when applied to complex multilayered documents in which you want to specify constraints on structural , spatial , temporal and conceptual relationships between components .\n-LRB- rdf Property Type ID = contains_sequences -RRB- -LRB- rdfs comment -RRB-

within RDF .\nThere are three ways of specifying data types within RDF Use the primitive Literal data type available within the RDF schema definition .\nThis is any quoted string .\nImplement a kind of enumerated data type by defining the range to be a class with a number of predefined instance values .\nThis is used in the example below to define the possible values for shot transitions .\nPoint to a separate namespace in which the data types have been defined .\nIn the example below we refer to http \\/ \\/ www.w3.org \\/ TR\\/datatypes for any data types other than literal .\nThis namespace doesn t currently exist but it is intended to define this within the W3 C XML Schema Working Group 10 which has recently been set up .\nBelow is an example of the RDF Schema code defining some of the scene , shot , frame and object properties .\nIt illustrates the three data typing methods available .\n-LRB- rdf Property Type ID = start Time -RRB- -LRB- rdfs domain rdf resource = # Scene -RRB-

the context of this application , have the following advantages RDF Schema is able to provide meanings to elements or semantic structure not possible using purely syntactic schemas such as XML DTDs . .\nHowever the sorts of machine-understandable meanings provided in the current version of RDF Schema is very limited - so the advantage of semantic validation is virtually negligible .\nThe other schemas really only provide implicit child or contains relationships between elements .\nWith RDF you can specify any relationship types explicitly through properties but this is limited by the need to specify a single range .\nIt isn t possible to constrain a particular relationship to multiple range\\/domain pairs e.g.\nsequences can only contains scenes which can only contain shots etc. .\nMultiple namespaces .\nThis enables the same feature to have different descriptors which correspond to different domains or description schemes .\nThe ability to mix classification vocabularies within one XML-based encoding allows video authors or others to deliver richer domain-specific content descriptions thus increasing the re-usability of the video on the Web .\nThis is a key requirement of the MPEG-7 DDL .\nInheritance is supported through sub-classes and sub-properties .\nThis provides easy extensibility and reuse of code .\nA simple RDF parser Si RPAC 11 exists but it has limited validation capabilities , checking only that the domain and range constraints are satisfied .\nIt is human-readable , simple to understand and thus simple to extend or customize .\n4.3 Limitations of the RDF Schema for Video Metadata RDF Schema has the following problems or limitations Unstable .\nThe RDF Schema specifications are still under development and change frequently .\nLimited or no data typing .\nAlmost all data typing will need to be provided by external namespaces , which don t yet exist .\nNo cardinality .\nIt isn t possible to specify optional , zero or multiple values for an attribute .\nRange constraints such as minimum and maximum values are not supported .\nClass-specific range constraints are not possible .\nOnly one range is possible for a given property .\nThe only way to do provide multiple ranges is to create multiple properties e.g.\nsecs_start_time , frame_start_time , SMPTE_start_time .\nRDF Schema can t describe multilayered structures using a single generic contains property .\nThis requires multiple specific contains properties i.e.\ncontains_sequences , contains_scenes , contains_shots , contains_frames .\nThe alternative is to implement code outside of the schema which understands DC .\nRelation .\nHas Parts semantics and can perform the validation .\nProperty-centricity makes readability difficult .\nThe link between properties and classes is defined within the property definitions not the class definitions .\nNo query language exists for RDF .\nGiven a video structure , to find videos with similar structures , you need to be able to store RDF structures in a directed graph with associated attribute values in a database .\nThe simplest way to specify spatial and temporal relationships is via the Collection elements Seq , Bag and Alt , but these provide limited semantics .\nSince no -LRB- Par -RRB- element exists within RDF , the -LRB- Bag -RRB- element must be used to specify parallelism .\nFor spatial relationships such as neighbors , if the list of neighbors is in a collection , can we assume that the first one is the nearest neighbor ?\nCan not map relationship-type properties between classes to constraints on the attribute values of the classes involved .\nFor example , if two scenes abutt then their respective end and start frame numbers must be consecutive .\nIf a sequence contains a scene , then the start and end times of the scene , must lie within the start and end times of the sequence .\nThis is not supported by RDF Schema .\nRDF Schema is an incomplete mapping of the RDF Syntax and Data model .\nThere are very useful features available within the RDF Syntax and Data Model Spec .\nwhich aren t supported in the RDF Schema .\n5 .\nXML DTDs Extensible Markup Language XML Document Type Definitions DTDs provide a subset of SGML for describing documents .\nXML was developed by the XML Working Group under the World Wide Web Consortium W3 C in 1996 .\nThe complete XML spec .\nis available from the W3 C. 12 .\nEach XML document has both a logical and a physical structure .\nPhysically , the document is composed of units called entities .\nAn entity may refer to other entities to cause their inclusion in the document .\nA document begins in a root or document entity .\nLogically , the document is composed of declarations , elements , comments , character references , and processing instructions , all of which are indicated in the document by explicit markup .\nThe logical and physical structures must nest properly .\nThe function of the markup in an XML document is to describe its storage and logical structure and to associate attribute-value pairs with its logical structures .\nXML provides the document type declaration , to define constraints on the logical structure and to support the use of predefined storage units .\nAn XML document is valid if it has an associated document type declaration and if the document complies with the constraints expressed in it .\nDocument type declarations are made in a Document Type Definition DTD file .\nThe DTD file then contains a formal definition of a particular type of document outlining the element names and the structure of the document .\n5.1 An Example of an XML DTD for Video Documents The structure is defined in the element definitions at the top of the DTD .\nEach element has a set of associated attributes .\nAll elements have an ID attribute plus the DC attributes .\nIn addition , sequences , scenes and shots also have a set of time attributes begin , end , duration .\nEach element also has its own set of level-specific attributes which will correspond to the MPEG-7 descriptors when they become available .\n-LRB- ? xml version = 1.0 ? -RRB- -LRB-

associated with a single namespace .\nUsers only have to understand one namespace .\nXML is simpler than SGML , Hy Time etc. .\nXML DTDs are easy to read and understand .\nShort and sweet without all that data typing .\nHierarchical structures are supported but only on a syntactical basis .\n5.3 Disadvantages of XML DTDs for Video Metadata No name spaces .\nSince name spaces are not supported , definitions such as Dublin Core attributes will need to be redefined unless external entities are used .\nExternal entities provide a similar capability to namespaces .\nAn external entity can be retrieved from an external DTD via a URI to this DTD and the entity s ID .\nCardinality of attributes is zero or one in XML DTDs .\nThis creates problems with DC attributes which are optional and repeatable .\nThey may need to be declared as elements .\nThere is very limited support for data typing .\nOnly three kinds of attribute types are supported a string type , a set of tokenized types and enumerated types .\nHowever Bray 14 has shown that it is possible to attach strong type declarations to XML elements using reserved attributes .\nIt is a purely syntactic machine-understandable schema which can t provide any of the semantics associated with complex structured multimedia data or support object-oriented data modelling concepts .\nThere is no inheritance .\nThere are no relationships possible other than the implicit contains .\n6 .\nDocument Content Description DCD for XML The Document Content Description DCD 15 facility for XML is an RDF vocabulary designed for describing constraints to be applied to the structure and content of XML documents .\nIt consists of a set of properties used to constrain the types of elements and names of attributes that may appear in an XML document , the contents of the elements and the values of the attributes .\nIt was designed to provide semantics over and above the purely syntactical XML DTDs .\nIt was also designed to be conformant with the RDF Model and Syntax Specification with some simplifications .\nDCD also incorporates a subset of an earlier submission to W3 C , the XML - Data Submission 16 .\nThe introduction to the XML - Data Submission says that it describes an XML vocabulary for schemas , that is , for defining and documenting object classes .\nIt can be used for classes which are strictly syntactic for example , XML or those which indicate concepts and relations among concepts as used in relational databases , KR graphs and RDF .\nThe former are called syntactic schemas ; the latter conceptual schemas .\nThus , XML - Data and DCD add object-oriented and data modelling concepts such as class inheritance to purely syntactic schemas such as XML DTDs .\nDCD Schemas are based on elements and attributes .\nElements correspond to RDF property types .\nDCD declarations constrain the content and attributes of elements in document instances , by assigning properties to objects of type Element Def and Attribute Def .\n6.1 Example of a DCD Schema The DCD Schema below is based on the following assumptions The Dublin Core elements are all described in a separate name space .\nThe root element video_doc contains video_sequences which contains video_scenes etc. .\nThe Dublin Core elements apply to every level .\nIn addition the sequence , scene and shot elements possess start_time , end_time and duration elements .\nIn addition , each level has its own unique elements\\/attributes corresponding to MPEG-7 descriptors .\n-LRB- DCD xmlns DC = http \\/ \\/ purl.org\\/metadata\\/dublin_core#

provides upper and lower bound constraints on attribute values .\nProvides cardinality .\nSupports multiple namespaces .\nAs an RDF vocabulary , it inherits the advantages of the data modelling concepts in RDF , plus constructs such as RDF Seq and RDF Alt .\n6.3 Disadvantages of DCD for Video Metadata Currently no subclassing or inheritance but this is planned for the future .\nThe proposal is to create subclasses from existing elements through an extends property .\nOnly basic data typing is supported , not complex data types .\nThere is no support for multiple alternate data types , except if you create alternate elements with different data types e.g.\nstart_time value can be SMPTE , secs , frames int .\nAlso there is no support for constraining the values of certain attributes of related elements .\nDoesn t support data types such as points , lines , polygons , color histograms etc. .\nThese would all have to be described in a separate namespace e.g.\nhttp \\/ \\/ www.w3.org \\/ TR\\/complex _ datatypes .\nIt is not possible to specify that just the element s datatype is to be a value from another namespace .\nYou need to specify that the element itself is totally described in another namespace .\nOnly Seq and or Alt Groups are available .\nBag is not a legal value for the RDF Order property .\nSeq is fine for specifying sequential components but for multimedia , there is also a need to support groups of elements which run in parallel .\nThe RDF Bag element is the most suitable for specifying this , in the absence of any Par value , but it isn t supported in DCD .\n7 .\nSchema for Object - Oriented XML SOX Schema for Object - Oriented XML SOX 17 provides a facility for defining the structure , content and semantics of XML documents to enable XML validation and automated content checking .\nSOX provides an alternative to XML DTDs for modeling markup relationships .\nThe introduction to the SOX specification says that it provides the following advantages over XML DTDs More efficient software development processes for distributed applications ; Basic intrinsic datatypes ; An extensible datatyping mechanism ; Content model and attribute interface inheritance ; A powerful namespace mechanism ; Embedded documentation .\nSOX supports three varieties of datatypes scalar datatypes , enumerated datatypes and format datatypes .\nScalar datatypes are derived from the basic number datatype , and support specification of the number of digits and decimal places , minimum and maximum value range , and a mask .\nAn enumerated datatype may be derived from any of the intrinsic datatypes , and may specify an enumeration of valid values .\nA format datatype may be derived from any of the intrinsic datatypes , and must specify a mask .\nIn SOX , element types may inherit their content models and attribute definitions directly from another named element type .\nAn element type may also inherit and extend an attribute list .\nSpecialization of attribute definitions allows refinement and restriction of attribute datatype , enumeration list and default value .\nAdditionally , an attribute value may be defined to be inherited from the identically named attribute on a parent or older ancestor element .\nThus , for example , namespaces can be inherited from superordinate elements .\nThe SOX namespace facility enables Objects from any identifiable namespace to be used in building a SOX document .\nThat is , any element , attribute , datatype , enumeration , entity , interface , notation , parameter , or processing instruction may be imported from any namespace .\nA SOX document is a valid XML document , according to the SOX DTD .\nThe schema designer is free to employ the same XML tools used for traditional XML documents .\nThis means that a SOX document can processed by a validating XML parser , formatted according to an XSL stylesheet , and managed by any DOM-compliant or SAX-compliant application .\n7.1 SOX Example In this example , the structural elements , video_doc , video_sequence , video_scene , video_shot , video_frame and video_object are declared first .\nThey each possess the DC attributes , plus their own specific elements and attributes .\n-LRB- schema name = video_doc namespace = http \\/ \\/ www.dstc.edu.au\\/schemas\\/video_doc.xml -RRB- -LRB- h1 -RRB- Video

to perform complete validation of SOX-specific constraints , extra parsing code will be required .\nProvides much better data typing capabilities than the other schemas - scalar , enumerated and formatted data types .\nSOX provides the best cardinality with occurs n , m .\nInheritance provides the possibility for reuse of code , elements and datatype definitions .\nElements can inherit their definitions from existing elements using instanceof and also extend with new attributes using extends .\n7.3 Disadvantages of SOX for Video Metadata SOX was designed for validating business documents in e-commerce applications .\nConsequently it is more suitable for validating static forms than complex multimedia structures .\nIt is element-focussed rather than entity-focussed .\nIt only provides the implicit contains relationship .\nStructural constraints would require multiple contains elements .\nInheritance is possible but users can only extend elements with new attributes .\nIdeally one should be able to extend elements with both new attributes and new elements .\nNot an RDF vocabulary .\n8 .\nConclusions the Ultimate Schema None of the above schemas is ideal for describing complex multimedia documents .\nThey all satisfy some of the requirements but fall down in other areas .\nNone of them is designed for describing complex hierachical structures in which there are spatial , temporal , structural and conceptual relationships between the components and where these relationships map to constraints on the relative attribute values of the related components .\nFor example , spatial relationships such as neighbors , in-front-of , behind , overlapping and surrounds correspond to certain constraints on the values of the shape , location or volume attributes of the related objects .\nSimilarly temporal relationships such as contains , sequential , parallel and overlapping should be mapped to constraints on the start time , end time and duration of the components .\nNone of the schemas support these capabilities .\nRDF Schema claims to differ from the other schemas , in that it is not a syntactic schema but a semantic schema .\nHowever the sorts of machine-understandable meanings provided in the current version of RDF Schema is very limited .\nSo the advantage of semantic validation is negligible .\nRDF Schema is good at containing and combining descriptors from different name spaces\\/communities but it has virtually no data typing .\nData types must be defined in a separate name space .\nThis has yet to be done but the work is intended to be done within the W3 C XML Schema Working Group 10 which has recently been set up .\nRDF Schemas also don t easily support multi-layered hierarchical structures because of the inability to specify generic relationship types using properties and to apply these across multiple domain\\/range pairs .\nSo although RDF is better than the other schemas because of its ability to specify relationships other than the implicit child or contains relationship which is the only one that the other schemas offer , this facility is limited to a specific range and domain due to the lack of class-specific constraints .\nXML DTDs offer simplicity and fast , cost-effective development due to the ready availability of parsers , tools and applications .\nHowever , as a data modelling language , they have limited semantics , which XML - Data , DCD and SOX schemas try to expand by adding things such as strong data typing and lexical constraints .\nDCD is an improvement on XML DTDs because it provides better data typing and also provides additional semantics via its RDF conformity .\nHowever it doesn t currently support inheritance - although this is a future goal .\nSOX has the best data typing .\nIt is also XML compliant so that XML parsers and XML - QL when it becomes available will work on it .\nIt supports inheritance but with attribute extension only , not element extension .\nIt is not RDF-conformant .\nSOX also provides the best cardinality - enabling the minimum other than 0 or 1 and maximum number of children of an element to be specified e.g.\nmaximum of 10 shots per scene .\nDCD and XML DTDs can only specify zero or more or one or more children .\nRDF - Schema doesn t support cardinality .\nAn additional desirable schema feature would be the ability to define equivalence relationships between attributes and define constraints based on these relationships .\nFor example , suppose there are two attributes , Colour Text and Colour Histogram .\nThen in an ideal schema , users would be able to define an enumerated data type for Colour Text red , yellow , green , blue etc and for each of these possible values , a correponding permissable range of Colour Histograms would be defined .\nAn even more complex example is the mapping of a textual description attribute to some combination of shape , color and texture attribute value ranges .\nSuch a schema could then be used to both validate the integrity of the input data but also automatically generate metadata where it is not provided .\nThis ability to map from high-level features such as text to low level features color , shape , texture is one of the requirements of the MPEG-7 DDL .\nIt would also greatly improve the searchability of complex multimedia archives .\nNone of the schemas examined provide such sophisticated capabilities .\nOther relevant schemas not covered in this paper include the XSchema specification 18 and XML - Data 16 .\nXSchema is very similar to SOX .\nFormerly known as XSD , XSchema began as a proposal for the representation of XML DTDs as XML documents .\nThe advantages of using XML document syntax to describe XML document structures include the ability to browse and edit XSchemas using XML-aware tools .\nThis can t be done on DTDs which are not pure XML documents .\nAlthough XML - Data has some very useful features , it appears to have been superseded by DCD .\n8.1 The Ideal Schema for Multimedia Based on the above analysis and comparisons , the best solution for video metadata representation is one which provides the object-oriented , semantical concepts of RDF but expresses them within an easily-understood , human-readable XML schema .\nWe have proposed such a XML schema for the MPEG-7 DDL 19 which provides the following features The semantics and object-oriented concepts of inheritance provided by RDF through classes , sub-classes , properties and sub-properties ; The extensible data typing capabilities of SOX ; The addition of a relation entity which allows spatial , temporal , structural and conceptual relations to be defined between classes and constraints on the domain , range and property values to be specified ; The XML namespace facility ; Cardinality ; Temporal and spatial controls and specifications ; Linking mechanisms which enable links between descriptions and between content and descriptions ; The two major problems associated with this proposal are that it constitutes yet another schema or language and there are likely to be quite complex extensions necessary to the basic XML parser in order to perform complete validation of all of the constraints .\nThe W3 C XML Schema Working Group 10 is looking at a XML-based schema language which provides support for data typing and structural constraints , currently lacking in XML DTDs .\nTheir charter includes delivering a recommendation on the best combination of DCD , XML - Data , SOX and RDF for validating document syntax .\nBased on the XML Schema Requirements document 20 , there is a very real possibility that the schema which they develop will satisfy the majority of the MPEG-7 DDL requirements

'Poland Hunter Jane Simpson Cemetery Markers for David and Andrew Hunter , Old Methodist Cemetery , Tionesta , Forest , PA The Hunter families of Northwestern Pennsylvania are of Scotch - Irish ancestry , a hardy race in which the Scotch stability , shrewdness , mental vigor and physical energy are blended with the geniality , warmheartedness , ambitions and versatile genius of the Irish .\nThese Hunters come from County Tyrone and County Down in Ireland .\nPoland Hunter , born in 1760 in Ireland , arrived in Westmoreland , Pa in the latter part of the eighteenth century .\nHis wife was Jane Simpson , an English native , who is reputed to have married Poland against her family s wishes .\nIt is said that this is the same Simpson family from which Ulysses S. Grant is descended .\nPoland and Jane were of true pioneer stock and with all the hopefulness of the Irish and the determination of the Scotch blood , built a rude cabin cleared a field in the forest and thereby supplied the wants of their growing family .\nSixteen children were born to Poland and Jane , twelve of which grew to maturity .\nIn 1795 Poland Hunter and his family moved to Tionesta and as a squatter appropriated the Island which bears his name , located at the mouth of the Tionesta River .\nHere he built his permanent home , farmed the island and as a permanent settler obtained from the state a patent establishing ownership .\nPoland and Jane lived on the island most of their lives , although in later years Poland moved to the west side of the river .\nAt the base of the hill known as Hog Back near Hunter Run he built the first grist mill in Forest County .\nWhen he died Poland Island was left to his son William for taking care of him during the last years of his life .\nOwnership of the island remained in the Hunter family until 1864 when the heirs sold it and the land bordering it on the river shore for $ 14,500 .\nLater owners include R. J. Harmon , Dan Mullet , the Pioneer Material Company , Jamieson Lumber and Supply Company , Frank Ellis and F. R. Lanson .\nJack Sherman purchased it in February 1953 and established the Tionesta Sand Gravel Company .\nIn addition to farming , Poland engaged in lumbering , kindred pursuits in those days . .\nThe History of Warren County related the following anecdote about Poland Hunter , About the year 1810 while Henry Kinnear was acting in the capacity of constable in Venango County , he had a warrant for the arrest of a notorious ruffian and desperado named Polen Hunter .\nAgainst the threats of the criminal , Kinnear attempted his forcible apprehension , when he received from Hunter a wound in the hip from which he never recovered .\nIt is said that he succeeded in obtaining pecuniary redress for his injury .\nThe History of Forest County , published in 1868 , tell the following story , Poland Hunter was a pretty rough specimen of Irish humanity .\nHe would sometimes take on more tanglefoot than he could walk straight under and staggering against a stump would say , H -- l agin a stump and Poland agin that .\nPoland Hunter shot a man by the name of Kinnear who had a warrant for his arrest .\nHunter peppered him with shot about the legs .\nThe wound was not mortal .\nHunter said that shooting him had made him a storekeeper and if he would let him shoot him again he would make a wholesale merchant out of him .\nWilliam Hunter was a chip of the old block .\nWhenever he got too much crooked whiskey his temper got the best of him and everybody was in his way .\nHe and a man by the name of Groff always fought when they met .\nGroff was small but full of grit .\nIn one of their fights Hunter bit Groff s finger .\nThe next day Groff was crossing the river to Hunter s grist mill .\nHe hallooed to Hunter when half-way over the river , I m bringing you another grist of finger nails to grind .\nThough there are no historical records documenting the reason for the warrant on Poland Hunter , it is likely the result of legal dispute with John Range Sr. over the ownership of Hunter s Island .\nChief Cornplanter was called in to be a witness and to testify that he had passed through the back channel in a canoe , thereby proving that Hunter s Island was indeed an island .\nHunter won the first case ever tried in Venango County .\nLater on , Poland s son William would marry Lt. John Range s granddaughter , Sarah Range .\nPoland Hunter prospered and survived the hard life of a pioneer until 1840 , dying at the age of eighty .\nHis wife Jane , companion to all his privation and success had died two years earlier .\nThe party spirit ran high , both then and now and Poland Hunter and his children were stalwart adherents of the Democratic party .\nBurial was in the private Hunter cemetery on the west side at the approach of the hill from Tionesta to Oil City .\nChildren of Poland Hunter and Jane Simpson Harriet Hunter Jane Hunter John Hunter Moses Hunter Ellen Hunter George Hunter David Hunter b.\n1786 , d. 17 May 1862 in Tionesta , Forest , PA , buried in Old Methodist Cemetery , Forest , PA married Mary Gates daughter of Henry Gates and widow of Joseph Dale d. 5 June 1872 and buried in the Old Methodist Cemetery , Forest , PA Andrew Hunter b.\n1788 , d. 19 Apr 1814 , buried in the Hunter Family Cemetery , Tionesta , Forest , PA William Hunter b.\n1794 in Westmoreland Co , PA married on 6 Aug 1815 Sarah Range b.\n27 Mar 1800 in Hartford Co , MD James Hunter b.\n1797 , d. 20 May 1813 , buried in the Hunter Family Cemetery , Tionesta , Forest , PA Special thanks to James Ball for providing this information .\nReturn to Forest County Home Page c Forest County Pennsylvania Genealogy Project\nForest County , Penna Poland Hunter\n',025

.\n________________________________________________________________ NARRATIVE BY JANE HUNTER HODGSON This account of the life of Eva Nellie Holden was written in 1991 by her granddaughter , Jane Anne Hunter Hodgson , daughter of James Boyd Hunter .\nSources were birth and death certificates as well as first hand accounts from Eva s daughter , Lillian Shuler Sillaway , Eva s daughter-in-law , Theodosia Mc Keeman Hunter , and Paul Cottrell who knew the family in Woodburn , Indiana .\nThe actual occurrences described are facts .\nEva s crying as she put on her bridal gown was related to Lillian by Eva herself , as well as the love she eventually kindled for James .\nTheodosia and Paul both told of her working at the Barnhill Sanatarium .\nSome of the connecting ideas were fabricated according to the explanations given to the author by the witnesses .\nJane Anne Hunter Hodgson I was born on the 23rd of August in the year 1873 in Findlay , Ohio .\nI was the first of three children born to my parents , Pearson Benjamin Holden and Flora Anne Barnhill .\nMy father operated a grist mill in Findlay , and he had come from the neighboring county , Putnam county , to marry my mother whose family had lived in Findlay for a number of years .\nMy mother and daddy had just lived through the traumatic years of the Civil War as they were growing up .\nFather s father had died in 1867 .\nGrandad was a rather well-known personage in this part of Ohio .\nHis name was also Pearson Benjamin Holden .\nHe was a preacher in the United Brethren Church .\nHaving been born in Virginia he took a pro-slavery stance against his church body .\nMy mother and father were married , and about a year later I was born .\nI soon had a brother , William Reed , and a sister , Jennie .\nWe grew up and went to school in Findlay .\nWe went to the Presbyterian Church where the Barnhills attended for years .\nIn 1887 my parents were divorced .\nMy mother was having a very hard time holding the family together since my father was down in Georgia and not sending any money for the family s expenses .\nWhen I was about 18 years old , a man came through our town .\nHis name was James Boyd Hunter .\nHe was a furniture manufacturer in Chicago .\nHe talked about so many far away places like Chicago , the big city with all of its modern conveniences .\nHe talked about Canada where he was born in a city called London .\nI was fascinated with all that he had to say , and I think he thought that I was very pretty .\nHe started courting me .\nBecause he was almost 20 years older than me , my mother tried to put a stop to his bringing me flowers .\nThat made me want to see him even more .\nMy mama said that if his intentions were honorable , he should marry me , and so it happened just all very fast .\nOn New Years Eve , 1891 , we were married .\nI cried as I was putting on my bridal gown .\nI think I was suddenly afraid to leave the comfort and love of my family to go with this stranger to the huge city of Chicago .\nI was not even sure as I started down the aisle that I really loved him , and I feared that I was making a terrible mistake .\nbut it was too late for second thoughts .\nI took the plunge and soon we were headed off on my first ride away from all that I had ever known .\nChicago was such a big city .\nI loved the excitement !\nWe lived just a few blocks from Jim s business .\nHe owned the furniture business with another man named Mc Cue .\nI soon had a new friend , Mrs. Mc Cue .\nI was very thankful for her friendship , especially a few months later when I began feeling ill every morning .\nI suspected that maybe I would have a child .\nMrs. Mc Cue helped me through the days when I felt so poorly , and to my joy and Jim s joy , Flora Jane Hunter was born on the 3rd of January 1893 .\nMy days were filled with the fun of watching Janie grow .\nJim went off to the facctory every day and also traveled around on the trains to neighboring states looking for outlets for the furniture .\nI was busy shopping and cooking and minding the house every day .\nWhen I went to bed at night , I was exhausted .\nI would fall asleep listening to the clop of horses hoofs on the streets outside .\nIt seemed that in Chicago , someone was always coming or going , even in the middle of the night .\nIn 1895 my mother moved to Chicago to be with me and I was thankful to have her with me .\nMy sister moved over too and Sarah Jane married a Mr. Bates .\nThey lived in Riverside village .\nMama would spend part of her time with me and part with Jennie .\nOn the 25th of February , 1896 , we again had to call out the doctor in the middle of the night to come to the house .\nOur second child , a boy named Frederick was born .\nNow when I walked down to the butcher shop or the fruit store , I had Janie in tow and little Fred in the baby buggy .\nA picnic in the park was sometimes a treat in those days .\nIt was not long before those familiar symptoms returned , and on the 21st of November , 1897 , Hamilton Wellington was born .\nWe named him for my husband s father who had been the superintendent of schools in Toronto and London , Ontario .\nHe was born in Ireland and came to Canada with his parents as a young boy .\nIn October of 1899 , I told my loving husband that I suspected that child number 4 was on the way .\nHe was delighted as always .\nHe was a great support to me and a wonderful father to his children .\nI had grown to love him very much .\nWe had such a beautiful Christmas that year , with just the perfect toy for Jane and Fred and Ham .\nMama met a nice man here in Chicago named Wellington Bennett , and I was very happy for her when they decided to marry .\nI will never forget that day in February , 1900 .\nIt had snowed , and I was stuck in the house with the children .\nI was already getting my very rounded figure back with five months of baby proceeding as expected .\nWhen the officer came onto the doorstep , I couldn t imagine why he would come to my house .\nHe tried to soften the blow with his words , but the shock could have killed me when he said that Jim had been found dead on a Michigan Central train here in Chicago at about noon .\nHe was taken off to a hospital , and the policeman said that the doctors would have a report later on about what had happened .\nThings had never appeared so bleak as they did on that day in 1900 .\nWhat was I to do ?\nI did send word to some good friends who had moved just over the Indiana line into La Porte .\nThey came over and helped me through those days .\nWe took his body to the Congregational Church , and buried him in Rosehill Cemetery .\nI wondered where I could go and what I could do next .\nMy doctor said I must take good care of myself or risk losing the baby that I carried inside me .\nI know Jim would not have wanted anything to happen to his child , so I waited out the next four months there in our rented house in Chicago .\nOn the 19th of June , 1900 , James Boyd Hunter was born , named for the father who would never see him grow and mature .\nI now had my hands full , and felt overwhelmed with the prospects of living without a man in the city .\nMy friend who had moved to Indiana was now in a small town called Valporaiso .\nShe wrote and encouraged me to come there .\nSo , as soon as I got back on my feet after the birth , I began to pack up all that I owned for the move by horse and buggy to Valporaiso , Indiana .\nIt was not easy .\nThe money that the Mc Cues sent helped but I knew that I could not raise four children on that money .\nI began to look for some kind of work .\nOne day I met a man who was selling encyclopedias , door to door .\nHe told me how he got his job and put me in touch with the people who offered me a job selling .\nIt was a struggle to balance caring for the family and working .\nBut Jane was now ten years old , so she could help with the younger ones while I went off to bring in some money .\nI tried my hand at a variety of jobs in those days .\nIt was always the most difficult to hold a job when the children were sick .\nThey , of course , had their share of childhood sicknesses .\nIt was always a concern when the little ones were ill .\nI loved my children more than anything else in the world .\nOn the 14th of April I received word that my Mama had died in Riverside Village .\nShe had only three years of happiness with her new husband .\nIn 1904 , little Fred came down with a horrible stomachache one day .\nBy the middle of the night , I knew it was serious .\nThe town doctor came over early in the morning to see him .\nHe told us what to do .\nJane and I nursed him round the clock .\nAll of the children gathered around and tried to comfort him , but when he began to burn with fever and his speech became the ramblings of delirium , we were so frightened .\nOur beloved little Fred passed away that day .\nIt was like losing a part of my own heart .\nWe were irreconcilable .\nIn 1907 we moved to Woodburn , Indiana .\nMy mother s brother was a physician in Laotto and Woodburn .\nHe had a sanitarium there , the Barnhill Sanatarium .\nI felt that if we moved there , I could work at the Sanatarium , and things would ease up financially for the raising of my children .\nIt was becoming more and more difficult , and the doctor said that he would pay for my two boys to go to Howe Military School if I came to work for him .\nI felt this would be such a wonderful opportunity for Ham and Jim that I eagerly accepted the offer .\nThe move was made , and the two boys were sent off to school .\nI was put to work selling insurance so that people who bacame ill could be cared for in my uncle s sanatarium .\nThe years passed so quickly , and the children grew up so fast .\nIn 1908 , I met a man named Charles Wesley Shuler .\nWe began to fall in love , and I realized that he wanted to marry me .\nIt had seemed out of the question in the past that I could marry again since I had always put my children s needs first , but it now seemed to be the proper thing , and I was ready to get on with my own life .\nWe were married in 1910 .\nOn the 2nd of August , 1911 , Lillian Florence was born into our family .\nBy now Jane was a grown up young lady .\nI had saved the money to send her to finishing school .\nWe were now living on Holton Avenue in Fort Wayne , Indiana .\nHam was attending high school .\nJim was just eleven years old .\nMy marriage to Charles was rocky , but on the 2nd of December 1915 , our son William was born .\nCharles was not around much to help me with the children .\nBut I was used to managing on my own , so that was not a new challenge for me .\nI could see that our marriage would not work out .\nEventually , we were divorced .\nI now had Jim still at home and the two little ones .\nI loved my children very much so continued to work and to care for them .\nJim was in Fort Wayne High School when the war broke out in 1914 .\nHe went off to the Navy in 1917 , and Ham did too .\nThose were long years until he returned from the war .\nLillian and Bill and I were so overjoyed to see them return .\nIn the early 1920 s we moved to a house on Maple Place .\nWhen Jim married Theodosia Mc Keeman , they bought a little house on the same little court across the street from us .\nI saw my first grandchildren born .\nJane married Arthur Laudel , and they moved to Kansas City .\nThere in Fort Wayne in those years of my life , I was introduced by a friend to the Christian Science religion .\nI knew when I learned the principles of this new found religion that God had really helped me through all of the rough spots in my life and that he was really in charge of my life and health and mind .\nIt was with jubilation that I embraced these teachings and passed them on to Lillian .\nI told Lillian that when Jane was younger , I was able to send her to finishing school .\nI could not do that for Lillian , but I believe I gave her a better gift , and that was in the promises of God to his people .\nIt filled me with happiness to see Lillian grow and mature in her faith .\nIn 1931 I was married to Willard Long .\nNow that all of my children were grown , this seemed an ideal time for finding some new happiness in my life .\nNote On June 20 , 1933 , Eva Nellie died in Fort Wayne of a myocardial failure .\nShe was buried per her own wish at the side of her first husband , James Boyd Hunter in Chicago , Illinois .\n________________________________________________________________ HISTORY OF THE

'Clan Hunter As is typical with anyone of Scottish descent , I could likely claim any number of Clans as my own .\nI have chosen Clan Hunter for the simple and pragmatic reason that my nearest antecedent from Scotland was Jane Hunter .\nI am still only dabbling in searching that family line -- I ll have more time when I retire , right ??\nWhat I know thus far is that she and her parents , James Hunter and Margaret Allen Hunter , left Greenoch and arrived in New Brunswick in 1846 , settling at Perry Point Kings County .\nLater on in that same year she married John Tenpenny Murphy in St. John .\nI can only surmise what brought Jane and her parents to the New World -- there was famine in Scotland in those years and there had been several epidemics of typhus and cholera .\nI have also heard they , being weavers , did not like those new mechanized looms -- Luddites !\nMeanwhile , if you are a Hunter or a Murphy and some of your ancestors settled in New Brunswick , perhaps we can compare notes .\nI will soon have my Hunter genealogy\\/family history posted here .\nAt Hunterston Castle in West Kilbride , Ayrshire , Scotland , there is an ancient charter signed by seal of King Robert II the Bruce s grandson -- first in the line of the House of Stewart , granting the lands to William Hunter , the 10th Laird , on May 2 , 1374 .\nThe earliest record of Hunters in Scotland dates back to 1116 , where reference is made to William Hunter the 1st Laird being a witness to the Inquisition of King David I.\nKing David I would have invited Normans to join him in Scotland , friends to aid him in ruling an unruly kingdom , as David grew up in the Norman courts .\nThe name Hunter does derive from the occupation of our original kinsmen , but it implies much more .\nAs you will note by the Clan Crest , there is a coronet around the dog s neck , signifying a royal connection -- apparently our ancestor was excellent at his craft , having been appointed the Chief Hunter in Scotland by King David .\nThe charter and a replica of the Hunterston Brooch displayed at Hunterston Castle .\nThe original brooch was found in 1830 during excavations .\nIt is a stunning example of 8th century craftsmanship , combining Celtic and Anglo - Saxon designs .\nIt is 5 inches in diameter , made of silver , partially gilded , inset with gold , and studded with amber .\nThe original is on display in the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland , in Edinburgh .\nThe tartan background on this site is the current Hunter tartan .\nMadame Pauline Hunter of Hunterston , 30th Laird .\nMore pictures of Hunterston Castle here Here I am , representing Clan Hunter at the Western Massachusetts Highland Games and Celtic Festival , June 24 , 2000 .\nThe gentleman sitting in the tent is Steve May , a good friend of mine whose company , In Keeper , hosts this site and the WMass Games website .\nHe traveled all the way from West Virginia , with his new bride , Deb , to share the day .\nThis was my first time out representing the Clan at a games , and I had a great time doing so .\nThe Association was extremely helpful in calming my nerves and getting tent supplies to me in a timely fashion .\nI plan on doing it again next year !\nClan Hunter Links The official website for Clan Hunter Association , USA Tom Hunter , who is the President of Clan Hunter Association Canada , has a comprehensive site .\nThere is Clan Hunter merchandise and information on ordering .\nThe Gathering of the Clans has Clan Hunter pages , including a discussion forum .\nHeather s Hunter page , which includes links to other Hunter sites .\nHunter genealogy message board .\nElectric Scotland has a webboard system for hundreds of clans , including Clan Hunter .\nAll suggestions for other Hunter links welcome I have created a One List community for Clan Hunter .\nPlease join the email list set up exclusively for us !\nClick to subscribe to Hunter Clan The above link will bring you to the e Groups site .\nIf you want to jump right in and subscribe , then Subscribe to Hunter Clan Powered by www.egroups.com Thanks !\nClan Hunter\n',020

S. and Canada .\nShe and my father also shared an avid interest in ancient Egyptian culture and architecture .\nBy the time I was born , the family had already selected my name - it was to be Rachel Jane , for my Eubank and Jones great grandmothers .\nDaddy and Grandma , however , became rebels , and instead gave me a name from one of their favorite works of fiction , about an ancient Egyptian princess Teta who travels through time to reappear in the future as Iris .\nMrs. Fanny D. Eubank Note The Bridge of Time by William Henry Warner , 1869 - 1948 New York , Scott Seltzer , 1919 .\nOn visits to her cottage a mile or so from town , we would settle outside on the porch swing and chairs or inside on the sofa , and Daddy , Grandma , and Mama would talk about writing , family , politics , and recent reading .\nI would listen .\nA year or two before we moved away , my mother was our town s news correspondent to The Asheville Citizen .\nMims loved visiting Grandma and helping her with the garden .\nIt was Grandma who helped put together his first stamp and coin collection and encouraged him to continue .\nThose first collections grew over the years into his coin investment and appraisal business .\nHe would spend a few weeks at a time with Grandma , and she was so happy to have his company .\nOften they d walk the winding road down to the main highway from the cottage , pick up a few groceries at the old commissary , and start back up the road .\nAbout halfway along the road stood a great white rock with streaks of gray strata through it .\nGrandma and Mims would stop to rest and have a bite to eat there .\nThat ancient rock is still standing by the road , though tilted some by a dozer .\nHouses have since been built and cars now up and down the road .\nBut the rock still has company from the bicycle riders and a sprinkling of walkers and joggers , who may at times stop to rest by it .\nThe cottage is still at the top of the hill .\nMims died in 2000 , but he leaves a daughter , and a wife who continues his life long business .\nGrowing up , studying family photographs , I saw the resemblance between Mims my brother and Mims my grandfather .\nI feel that in many ways my brother reminded Grandma of Grandfather Eubank , whom she had divorced in 1914 , and who had returned to the family two years later .\nGrandfather Eubank died in 1917 .\nFanny died in 1948 .\nThey are buried side by side in a cemetery in Knoxville , several miles from where they had lived some of their happiest married days .\n1920 Our mother s Aunt Frances at thirty , the year of her marriage to D. W. Whisenhunt .\nAfter her husband s death in 1931 , during the depths of the Depression , Aunt Frances completed a correspondence course in nursing and worked for thirty-five years as a licensed practical nurse , with private patients from among the most prominent families in Asheville , North Carolina .\nShe was with us until 1966 .\nThrough the years she would visit , several times a year , and always on Christmas .\nShe was adventurous and daring .\nAfter retirement in her mid-sixties , she traveled with us on several family vacations .\nOn an excursion through the western states , she spent evenings writing dozens of postcards to Mrs. Frances B. Whisenhunt 1889 - 1966 friends and family back home about the glorious landscapes she was seeing .\nShe kept up or ahead of us on tours of Washington , D. C. and New York City , where she climbed in the heat and humidity of July the spiral and narrow iron steps up to the crown of the Statue of Liberty .\nOn visits she came with a fifth of White Port packed neatly in her square black suitcase , which always smelled of Cashmere Bouquet soap .\nAt some time during the visit , most likely soon after she arrived , she and my mother would sit down at the dining table and share a glass or two of Port .\nThey would share this rare time , chuckling about one thing or another .\nIt was a special time for both .\nMy mother was eager to catch up on family news back home in Asheville , Swannanoa , and Black Mountain .\nAnd Aunt Frances was interested to hear what was new with our family .\nAs a little girl growing up listening to their good time together , I learned to appreciate the joy of good conversation .\nBetty Jean - William and Bonnie s first - 1928 She was about two years old here .\nIt was 1930 , and the little dress was a light aqua blue silk crepe .\nOur mother kept the little dress like new and Betty still has it packed neatly away .\nAunt Hat had given it to her after Betty Jean and her mother had arrived at the Southern Railway Depot in Knoxville , homesick for Aunt Frances and Grandmother Eubank .\nBetty has always loved pretty dresses and shoes .\nShe remembers one shoe story William and Bonnie used to tell .\nIt was 1932 .\nThe Depression had worsened , and William and his young family had moved back near his sister and mother .\nWilliam Mims had been born in January , 1931 .\nOn Sundays especially , Betty Jean looked forward to visits with Uncle George and Aunt Trilby .\nGeorge operated for his mother s family , the Blacks of Myersville , Pennsylvania , one of the two major manufactories in town .\nDuring the Depression , at those times when all operations at the plant were shut down , Uncle George always made sure William had an income .\nAunt Trilby and Uncle George s children , Billy and Fanny Sue were about twelve and eight years old in 1932 .\nIt was happily customary after dinner on Sunday for all to get in the car and go for ice cream at one of the local drugstores .\nOn one of these trips Uncle George noticed Fanny Sue s shoes to be looking a little worn , and said to Trilby , Mother , don t you think Sister needs a new pair of shoes ?\nThey look a little worn .\nAt once , Betty Jean stretched out her little legs to see how her shoes compared to Fanny Sue s , which were said to be worn and in need of replacement .\nNot to pass up a gorgeous opportunity , Betty Jean immediately chimed in , moving her feet back and forth to attract attention , Well , I think I need some new shoes , too !\nEverybody got a big laugh , though Bonnie was some embarassed at Betty Jean being so forward .\nWilliam didn t actually hear Betty Jean s comment , for he hadn t been able to hear well since the War .\nBut the comment was appreciated by Uncle George , and Betty Jean s new shoes were delivered to the house within a few days .\nBetty Jean recalls another shoe delivery that has stuck in her memory all these years .\nIn 1940 Betty Jean was twelve years old and growing into a young lady - prissy , she says - with long and thick , dark auburn hair .\nWhen the knock came at the door , Bonnie asked Betty Jean to see who was at the door .\nImmediately Betty Jean was making her way to the door , and eating a prune at the same time .\nLooking through the door window , she saw a neighbor , Mr. Bristol , who was a supervisor at Uncle George s plant , and she opened the door .\nHe had in his hands what looked to be a shoe box in wrapping paper .\nBetty Jean , your Uncle George asked that I drop this package off to you on my way home , he said .\nIt was at this point that Betty Jean swallowed the prune pit .\nMr. Bristol , and Bonnie , who had joined them , watched as Betty Jean excitedly opened the package .\nShe barely noticed the pit going down .\nWhen she opened the box , resting in a nest of white tissue paper was a delicate pair of black patent leather dress-up pumps .\nShe said it was the little raised heel that sent her immediately dreaming of all those parties and socials to come .\nThose were her first pair of dress-up shoes .\nThe swallowed pit and this story became a special memory .\nLooking back now , we think behind this surprise delivery , there must have been a conspiracy between William , Uncle George and Mr. Bristol at the plant , and Bonnie at home .\nBonnie Katherine Jones b March 17 , 1907 d February 17 , 1996 My mother would say often that the very happiest time for her was childhood - free to be herself , no pressure to be something for someone else , just sunlight and friends , 1990 - Bonnie K. Eubank and son George and the many cousins , and the extended family who loved her .\nIn later life , after she had married and had four children , I knew that grown-up happy time for her had come to be the apple tree , the singing , and the gold transformed from those carefree days of childhood .\nI saw her lovely face dance in laughter when all the children and the grandchildren were bustling about .\nShe seemed once again spirited back to the exuberance of childhood she so often talked about .\nShe may , at times , have thought she left those times of joy among the meadows behind long ago .\nBut she hadn t. They surfaced so often .\nIn the photo above in 1990 , still lovely at eighty-three , my brother George took Mama for a spin in his new red sports car .\nJones Joshua Jones c 1740 Elinor Medley c 1740 Ireland Ulster From Albemarle , Virginia , Down the Great Wagon Road to Carolina Jackson m Elizabeth ?\nRussell m Sarah Hayes Thomas m Ann ?\nNancy m George W.

J.\nHunter , pastor of the Centenary Methodist Church , Hamilton , and the Rev.\nH. D. Hunter , M. A. , pastor of the First Congregational Church , London , Ontario .\nWilliam John Hunter received a good public school education , and afterwards attended Victoria University , Cobourg , pursuing a course in classics and metaphysics , and he obtained the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the Chicago University in June , 1878 .\nOur subject has not confined his attention entirely to church work , but has been zealous in the promotion of temperance , which may be regarded as a sister employment .\nWhenever the opportunity has arisen to use his voice in forwarding this great cause , he has not remained silent .\nHe is at present a member of the Royal Templars of Temperance .\nWith respect to his religious convictions , it need hardly be said that he has always been thoroughly satisfied with the doctrines of Methodism , and is a most able , broad-minded advocate of the name .\nHe married , on the 9th July , 1860 , Mary Jane , second daughter of Isaac Robinson , of Toronto .\nDr. Hunter entered the ministry of the Methodist Church in June , 1856 , and during the past twenty one years he has been in charge of some of the most important churches in London , Hamilton , Toronto , and Ottawa .\nThe Dominion Church at Ottawa was built under his direction , and is one of the finest ecclesiastical edifices in Canada .\nHe was chairman of the Ottawa district for three years , and secretary of the Montreal conference .\nHe is at present pastor of the Wesley Church , Hamilton , and superintendant of the Hamilton District .\nIt is only justice to say that Dr. Hunter is one of the ablest and popular ministers in the Methodist communion of this province .\nThere remains a possibility that , per son Hamilton s biography which you will see listed under him , that John and family may have spent the years from time of arrival in Canada , 1821 given in the above biography till 1831 in the Bytown area .\nJohn shows up first in the 1831 Noyan Census , then , as shown below , in the 1842 St. Armand Census .\nWe should not discount this completely till a thorough search has been made in Methodist and Presbyterian records in the Bytown area .\nSon , Robert B. s baptism may show up here .\n1842 St. Armand Census Hunter , John Shoemaker Proprietor 73 acres .7 in the family1 member absent2 natives of Ireland5 natives of Canada1 female 5 and under1 female above 5 and under 141 female married 14 -

Turner 1776-1854 , whose wife was Mildred Stone , 1780-1854 , of Henry County , was an officer in the War of 1812 , as weretwo of his brothers ; he later served as Sheriff of Franklin County , Sixof the brothers were Justices of the Peace ; two were Baptistministers .\nAlthough owning slaves , but known for their merciful treatmentof their servants , the family attempted to mitigate the rigors of thesystem .\nRemarkable in the social framework of the epoch , their willscarefully stipulated my servants are to be purchased by me legateesonly , with one further enjoining the executors suffer them not to besold otherwise .\nKings Grant s most stirring , momentous two days occurred in April 1865 , just as the doomed Confederacy was drawing its dying breaths with General Robert E. Lee s surrender at Appomattox Court House Stoneman s raid !\nSwarms of blue-clad Federal troops under command of General George Stoneman , units largely of the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry and the 10th Michigan Cavalry , suddenly appeared and spread out over the premises andsurrounding territory .\nEnroute from Salem , Virginia to North Carolina , burning and looting , the soldiers came one day and left the next , buttheir searches , confiscations and depredations were so thorough as toproduce shock and dismay to last a lifetime and beyond .\nOne eyewitnesssaid , The house hill was blue with Yankee uniforms ; they stoleeverything !\nAnother said , The reason they stayed overnight is they hadthree or four badly wounded soldiers , laid out in the front yard , withthe ladies of the house and the servants helping attend them .\nOne storywas the troops were bushwhacked near Bedford ; another was they werebushwhacked at Ferrum , instead .\nI vote for Ferrum !\nStill another , Thelast soldier to leave paused in the yard , looked back throughthe kitchen door and spied something hey hadn t stolen ; a fox hide tackedto the wall !\nSo , he came back , took the hide and rode slowly off down theroad toward Martinsville .\nThus Stoneman s raid ended for the Henry Community .\nOf recent generation , those who have resided the longest at the houseare Stephen Turner 1806-1884 , of the Civil War Period , and his wife Ruth Prillaman Turner 1813-1884 ; their daughter Martha Jane Turner Turner 1852-1935 and her husband James Alexander Cap Turner .\nTheirdescendantsalthough scattered geographically , still visit the area .\nKings Grant , or the Old Turner Place , after some recent restoration , continues itsdignified existence .\nOne prays that the Civil War s tumult andindescribable loss will never be repeated ; rather , as the old house andthe Henry Community embark on their third century , one earnestly praysthat the many happy days that both have enjoyed will followone another in unending succession .\nSubmitted by Dr. Harry Lee King , Jr. ... ... from De Cody Brad Marble1 .\nKings Grant The old Turner Place .\nPhotos provided by Herman Gayle Fisher .\nThe OLD TURNER PLACE house which was built circa 1790 , is on theland granted to Shadrack Turner , in Henry County , Virginia .\nStephen Turner Ruth Prillaman where occupants during Civil War .\nShadrach married Ann Pollard JHILL .\nThe child from this marriage was 25 i.
