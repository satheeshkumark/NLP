1. How to run Clustering Algorithms :

	1.1 Preprocessing :

		cd Satheeshkumar_Karuppusamy_System
		bash runPreProcessing.sh

	1.2 Load the input ARFF file from /Satheeshkumar_Karuppusamy_System/data/webps/arffs/"entityname".arff

	1.3 Apply StringToVector filter with the following settings :
	
		TF-IDF		-> true
		lowercase	-> true
		Tokenizer	-> Choose ngram and n as 2
		
	1.4 Use weka to perform Clustering using Algorithms like K-means Clustering, Hierarchical or EM Algorithm. Modify the number of clusters to the value that needs to be set. Save the output arff files as /Satheeshkumar_Karuppusamy_System/data/webps/arffs/"entityname_out".arff

	1.5 bash postProcess.sh

	Output "entityname.clust.xml" can be found at /Satheeshkumar_Karuppusamy_System/data/webps/arffs/
	
	1.6 Move them to a new system under /Satheeshkumar_Karuppusamy_CL and run

	bash runScorer.sh


2. How to run LDA :

	2.1 Preprocessing :

		Follow Step 1.1

	2.2 Apply LDA - Run Mallet

		bash runningMallet.sh

	2.3 Post Processing of Mallet Output

		bash malletPostProcess.sh
		
	Output "entityname.clust.xml" can be found at /Satheeshkumar_Karuppusamy_System/data/webps/arffs/


	2.4 Follow Step 1.6 for running the scorer
