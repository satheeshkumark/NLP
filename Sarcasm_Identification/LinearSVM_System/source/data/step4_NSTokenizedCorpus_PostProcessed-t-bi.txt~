robert griffin ii fumbles . i didn't want him to get hurt like this .
the redskinsare the worst . they fully jeopardized griffin's health . this guy never should have been on the field . tornacl
rg3down and thats game
rgii is done
as happy as i am that the seahawks got that ball i do not like seeing rg3 hurt
i know my mom makes jokes about how i'm growing up too fast but i know that she really does get sad thinking about it . awhcute
i think some people have a hard time just being nice
shannahan went to the well to many times .
shouldn't of kept rgii in selfish
rg ii out for year !
rg ii done off a bad snap .. not even like he was tackled
well there goes @DEFAULT_USER ' s season smh
damn he's done

and there goes rg3 ..
why sacrifice your star of future ? @DEFAULT_USER
shit rg3 is gonna be out for a while , that fall looked horrible .
game .. rg3 tore something ..
i really couldn't understand why rg3 has been in the game this long byebyeknee
shannahan is a dipshit !
rgii just lost everything in his knee
rg3 is gonna be out for a while now .
uh , i don't think @DEFAULT_USER will be playing in the pro bowl , let alone the super bowl .
i have more followers on instagram than twitter .
he's done for a bit
sad to see the redskins go out like this . seattlewashington
i guess it's time to move out of kali's house and go back to my own because of school tomorrow 😔
something tells me rgii is gonna have a comeback like ap had a comeback
shanahan and snyder , this @DEFAULT_USER injury is on you .
all i can read are pissing bestmoviequoteswhich are reminding me of the little umber of films i've actually seen
i really really hate that feeling when you wanna cry and the years just won't come out .
well there goes rg3's knee .
oh no rg3sknee is gone !!
i can not believe they had rg3 in this game
rh3 will never be the same
this is heartbreaking to watch ! rg3 is playing with everything he has but should not be out there . that looked bad ! hope he is okay !
kids born today dont know about blockbuster video or reading the sunday newspaper comic strips .
and rgii just tore something in his knee
the aspca commericals .
rgii just snapped his shit up .
really feel bad for rg3 hopefully his knee will be at full health by next year
should be asleep but can't in pain :(
peoples interpretation of the word love these days is dysfunctional . let me correct you your not in love ur just afraid to be alone .
@DEFAULT_USER if i change my name to sexwithpayne will you notice me because you only notice like gangbangedby1d or gaysextape .
how do you leave rg3iin this game ? his knee just hyper extended again going for a low snap .. sick
rg3 = boobie miles
his knee is fucked
that had to hurt !! redskinsquarterback
vacations are over
i actually feel bad .. ow
i respect the hell out of rgii but he has to have the leadership to take himself out of the game and give his team the chance to win
i hate the animal abuse commercials .. i always turn the channel . 😔 cruel
his knee is fucked .. i wouldn't wish that upon anyone . good game rg3 !
already balling from the notebook and then they decide to put on the animal abuse commercial . wtfcool
watching these thieves in action in ross . why would you steal from the cheapest store in beaumont . broke
when my moms mad or disappointed in me , i feel like my entire worlds falling apart
they shoulda pulled him earlier
crud .. talk about pushing the limits .
i do feel terrible for rg . know how it feels .
rgii is done
damn i'm obviously not a redskins fan but i hate to see what is happening to rg3 right now
rg3 , knees aren't meant to bend that way .
damn i felt like i was watching derrick rose get hurt smh nfl
rg3 going down
addicted to a game on my phone my mum suggested
@DEFAULT_USER an injury that originated by the ravens-
i think we just lost guys
need someone to talk to .
rg3 will never be the same
he just laid there ..
my life is changing and i don't know how to respond to the changes ..
rg3 is all done ! kids career is just being destroyed bec he plays hurt all the time and ends up injuring himself even more !
seeing the redskins fans faces <<<<
sad i don't wanna be hurt again , but if it happens it happens !
all the blame needs to go to shanahan for rgii being in the game . now he might be lost for a year . kirkcouldofwon
haven't felt this low in a long time
so sad to see rg3 giving it everything he has on a bad knee for his team , and then he blows it out trying to pick up a bad snap .
@DEFAULT_USER true shit . i was never a real fan lmao . i'm only supporting cause i lost a bet .
rgii just can't catch a break with his knee
@DEFAULT_USER word smh
not lookin good for skins
hope that redskinshaven't seriously messed up rg3 .. but its not like they haven't f**ked things up before
he was trying to help his team win a playoff game through an injury .. he sacrificed a lot
;( :( ;( :( ;( <<<<<< mood at the moment ! fuckughsmh
it's gone midnight , i'm up at 6 and i have my mum sat at the end of my bed refusing to leave as she's on draw something to @DEFAULT_USER
by by rgii :( cya next year ..
why are the guys in that @DEFAULT_USER commercial making snow men by themselves ?
rg3 , he gon .
fritz doesn't remember me
the redskins might as well have stephen hawkins at quarter back right now .. can't believe they're playing him soinjure
@DEFAULT_USER she doesnt like me homie feelhate
really hope rgii will be healthy next year . that looked like an ugly knee injury .
good timing on my last tweet riprg3
i hate slow motion views . poor rgii . i don't think the redskinscan pull this off now :-( . man this is
@DEFAULT_USER for me it was kind of like when d rose tore his acl
one of the worst coached games i've ever seen . fuck you shanahan . hopefully this isn't the last we'll see of robert griffin .
did anyone just see rg3's acl and mcl blow out ? ouch
big gulps ehh .. whelp see ya later @DEFAULT_USER
they should have taken him out he was clearly not ok earlier in gm-not worth ur career
rgii might have polished that knee injury off right there ..
noo ! not rg3 going down !
rg3sknee is gone !!
my heart goes out to lauren ..
they just kept pushing him and pushing him .. and while still in revovery .. the knee just finally gave out ..
rg3 is so injury prone ..
shouldn't of even been in the game .
rg3is done .
making my pillow smell like one million so i can pretend i had a boy over
@DEFAULT_USER and that is why we will never run away together .
i think the decision to keep playing rg3 goes higher up than shanahan i think word from daniel snyder was to play him unless he couldnt
should of taken mr. griffin out .. his acl is gone
@DEFAULT_USER i miss youu :(( jad soo much already ! can't believe i am not going to see u until 6 months ;(
terrible decision by redskins coaching staff and organization allowing rg3to play this far . that was an injury waiting to happen
this the first time i leave without saying bye ..
redskins really gonna blow his career for one game
16 weeks of football & you don't see everybody tweeting about it until the playoffs .
there's a reason why teams have coaches . to make tough decisions when those decisions might not be popular . shanahan failed .
don't know why i find drinking out of a maccies cup so exciting ? filling them back up with coke at home ..
@DEFAULT_USER an injury that originated playing the #ravens -
@DEFAULT_USER hmm yeah :/ the sims 3 i had to have it ! so the only way was to get an xbox oops ha ! i'm cool 😎 aww love pikachu the cutie
i'm gonna kill myself cuz of school tomorrow .. i don't wanna go there my holiday was soo fantastic i can't stand to go there :(

@DEFAULT_USER i wanted your 6,800 th tweet but didn't get it
my bed is soo uncomfortable just ordered a mattress topper of amazing
damn that sucks redskinsat least they made the playoffs unlike the giants :(
shocker a professional team plays an injured player when they shouldn't ..
" @DEFAULT_USER : if that young man is hurt bad they're gonna run mike shanahan and his son outta town ! redskins " you might be right .
rgll coming down is like when paqciauo , jeter , and d-rose came down
@DEFAULT_USER this is so sad . my family had the longest family owned paper in the world .. est . 1836 . the delaware gazette . we sold .
i guess @DEFAULT_USER don't care about me . :'(
@DEFAULT_USER been there .. done that ! definitely blown !
i've accepted the fact that @DEFAULT_USER will never notice me on twitter and i will never meet the boys .
@DEFAULT_USER @DEFAULT_USER @DEFAULT_USER same thng i said ..
why redskins fans givin up hope ? have a little faith in your team .
@DEFAULT_USER and i have such pointless conversations that my dad has to cut us off .
me and @DEFAULT_USER lives consist of playing draw something and words hd every night
rip to rg3's knee and the skins season unlucky
too bad i have nobody to dedicate my 500th tweet to
how do i cheer myself up now ? i finished every season of how i met your mother .
@DEFAULT_USER hey theismann i didn't see lawrence taylor even come close to you ! had to have been seriously injured before that play ..

rg3 probably just tore his acl .
aw damn ! noo ! down goes rg3 ! hate to see athletes , good or bad , go down ! smh
@DEFAULT_USER @DEFAULT_USER i've literally just managed to get over this and forget about it but then you have to go and bring it up again

forced to rip my acrylics off til thursday because 5 were missing and i think that's embarrassing to go in public :(
rgii probably shouldn't have still been playing

@DEFAULT_USER reminds me of boobie miles in friday night lights . shouldnt have been in the game . rg3kneeinjury
@DEFAULT_USER i really wonder if rg3 could hold up in the league , may have gotten my answer
i have this desire for hot chocolate but we don't have any ..
mike shanahan need his ass beat ! rgii been hurt ..
i haven't been up this early in awhile ..
