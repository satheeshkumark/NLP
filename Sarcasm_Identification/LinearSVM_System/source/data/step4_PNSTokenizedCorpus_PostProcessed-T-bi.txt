watched how to train your dragon , rio , hairspray , project x and friends wi benefits so many times this holiday i know them off by heart
@DEFAULT_USER you will never notice me .. :(
the ending of the notebook gets me everytime .
tyga - far away . deepthinking
he lies , she cries . he's not sorry , but he apologizes . she complains , he doesn't change . but yet , she still stays .. storyofmylife
when @DEFAULT_USER only has . 7 tweets
@DEFAULT_USER what do you mean you don't know me , we've known eachother since grade 9 . forgotten
from u have to tell someone that ur a galiss it just shows everyone that ur lying about gettin p**sy .
hey future husband , msg me so we can get married have cute babys & move far away from belvidere .
when i need to talk .. where are you ? no where or either you don't wanna talk to me .
bo and eddie stole my heart today ..
tbh i just want to see nicholas cage in more movies . he fell off of the face of the earth .
