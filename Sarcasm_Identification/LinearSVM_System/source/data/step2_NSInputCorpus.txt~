all the blame needs to go to shanahan for rgii being in the game. now he might be lost for a year. kirkcouldofwonit#sad
haven't felt this low in a long time #sad
so sad to see rg3 giving it everything he has on a bad knee for his team, and then he blows it out trying to pick up a bad snap. #sad
@default_user true shit. i was never a real fan lmao. i'm only supporting cause i lost a bet. #sad
rgii just can't catch a break with his knee #sad
@default_user word smh #sad
not lookin good for skins #sad
hope that redskinshaven't seriously messed up rg3.. but its not like they haven't f**ked things up before #sad

should of taken mr. griffin out.. his acl is gone #sad
@default_user i miss youu:(( jad soo much already! can't believe i am not going to see u until 6 months ;( #sad
