why sacrifice your star of future? @default_user
shit rg3 is gonna be out for a while, that fall looked horrible.
game.. rg3 tore something..
i really couldn't understand why rg3 has been in the game this long byebyeknee
shannahan is a dipshit!
rgii just lost everything in his knee
rg3 is gonna be out for a while now.
uh, i don't think @default_user will be playing in the pro bowl, let alone the super bowl.
i have more followers on instagram than twitter.
he's done for a bit
sad to see the redskins go out like this. seattlewashington
i guess it's time to move out of kali's house and go back to my own because of school tomorrow üòî
something tells me rgii is gonna have a comeback like ap had a comeback
shanahan and snyder, this @default_user injury is on you.
all i can read are pissing bestmoviequoteswhich are reminding me of the little umber of films i've actually seen
i really really hate that feeling when you wanna cry and the years just won't come out.
well there goes rg3's knee.
oh no rg3sknee is gone!!
i can not believe they had rg3 in this game
rh3 will never be the same
this is heartbreaking to watch! rg3 is playing with everything he has but should not be out there. that looked bad! hope he is okay!
kids born today dont know about blockbuster video or reading the sunday newspaper comic strips.
and rgii just tore something in his knee
the aspca commericals.
rgii just snapped his shit up.
really feel bad for rg3 hopefully his knee will be at full health by next year
should be asleep but can't in pain :(
peoples interpretation of the word love these days is dysfunctional. let me correct you your not in love ur just afraid to be alone.
@default_user if i change my name to sexwithpayne will you notice me because you only notice like gangbangedby1d or gaysextape .
how do you leave rg3iin this game? his knee just hyper extended again going for a low snap.. sick
rg3= boobie miles
his knee is fucked
that had to hurt!! redskinsquarterback
vacations are over
i actually feel bad.. ow
i respect the hell out of rgii but he has to have the leadership to take himself out of the game and give his team the chance to win
i hate the animal abuse commercials..i always turn the channel.üòî cruel
his knee is fucked.. i wouldn't wish that upon anyone. good game rg3!
already balling from the notebook and then they decide to put on the animal abuse commercial. wtfcool

i do feel terrible for rg. know how it feels.
rgii is done
damn i'm obviously not a redskins fan but i hate to see what is happening to rg3 right now
rg3, knees aren't meant to bend that way.
damn i felt like i was watching derrick rose get hurt smh nfl
rg3 going down
addicted to a game on my phone my mum suggested
@default_user an injury that originated by the ravens-
i think we just lost guys
need someone to talk to.
rg3 will never be the same
he just laid there..
my life is changing and i don't know how to respond to the changes..
rg3 is all done! kids career is just being destroyed bec he plays hurt all the time and ends up injuring himself even more!
seeing the redskins fans faces &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
sad i don't wanna be hurt again, but if it happens it happens!
all the blame needs to go to shanahan for rgii being in the game. now he might be lost for a year. kirkcouldofwon
haven't felt this low in a long time
so sad to see rg3 giving it everything he has on a bad knee for his team, and then he blows it out trying to pick up a bad snap.
@default_user true shit. i was never a real fan lmao. i'm only supporting cause i lost a bet.
rgii just can't catch a break with his knee
@default_user word smh
not lookin good for skins
hope that redskinshaven't seriously messed up rg3.. but its not like they haven't f**ked things up before
he was trying to help his team win a playoff game through an injury.. he sacrificed a lot
;( :( ;( :( ;( &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; mood at the moment! fuckughsmh
it's gone midnight, i'm up at 6 and i have my mum sat at the end of my bed refusing to leave as she's on draw something to @default_user
by by rgii :( cya next year..
why are the guys in that @default_user commercial making snow men by themselves?
rg3, he gon.
fritz doesn't remember me
the redskins might as well have stephen hawkins at quarter back right now.. can't believe they're playing him soinjure
@default_user she doesnt like me homie feelhate
really hope rgii will be healthy next year. that looked like an ugly knee injury.
good timing on my last tweet riprg3
i hate slow motion views. poor rgii.i don't think the redskinscan pull this off now :-(. man this is
@default_user for me it was kind of like when d rose tore his acl
one of the worst coached games i've ever seen. fuck you shanahan. hopefully this isn't the last we'll see of robert griffin.
did anyone just see rg3's acl and mcl blow out? ouch
big gulps ehh.. whelp see ya later @default_user
they should have taken him out he was clearly not ok earlier in gm-not worth ur career
rgii might have polished that knee injury off right there..
noo! not rg3 going down!
rg3sknee is gone!!
my heart goes out to lauren..
they just kept pushing him and pushing him..and while still in revovery..the knee just finally gave out..
rg3 is so injury prone..
shouldn't of even been in the game.
rg3is done.
making my pillow smell like one million so i can pretend i had a boy over
@default_user and that is why we will never run away together.
i think the decision to keep playing rg3 goes higher up than shanahan i think word from daniel snyder was to play him unless he couldnt
should of taken mr. griffin out.. his acl is gone
@default_user i miss youu:(( jad soo much already! can't believe i am not going to see u until 6 months ;(
terrible decision by redskins coaching staff and organization allowing rg3to play this far. that was an injury waiting to happen
this the first time i leave without saying bye..
redskins really gonna blow his career for one game
16 weeks of football &amp; you don't see everybody tweeting about it until the playoffs .
there's a reason why teams have coaches. to make tough decisions when those decisions might not be popular. shanahan failed.
don't know why i find drinking out of a maccies cup so exciting? filling them back up with coke at home..
@default_user an injury that originated playing the #ravens-

shocker a professional team plays an injured player when they shouldn't..
"@bighugh53: if that young man is hurt bad they're gonna run mike shanahan and his son outta town! redskins"you might be right.
rgll coming down is like when paqciauo, jeter, and d-rose came down
@default_user this is so sad. my family had the longest family owned paper in the world.. est. 1836. the delaware gazette. we sold.

i've accepted the fact that @default_user will never notice me on twitter and i will never meet the boys.
@default_user @default_user @default_user same thng i said..

it's really weird to see all these new college football fans come out of nowhere. do people really only care about championship games?
this game reminds me of permian panthers vs. dallas carter in friday night lights.
i remember when george told me i was so skinny that imma fall through my asshole. missyouunclerip

i haven't harmed myself for 3 years, i can only imagine what all this cut for beiber shit is doing for others if it's triggering me
some ppl can't make up their mind about if they want pussy or dick, lmao i guess they just wanna feel wanted.
sometimes i want to walk up to ppl, punch them in the face and walk away without giving them a reason and show them how it feels
i'm more pumped for @default_user birthday then she is..
how do you have a month to prepare forthis team and you have already given up 14 within the first 10 minutes of the game..
@default_user why are you not in switzerland!!

@default_user yes ma'am. he's hot but he ain't doin much as of right now. before the second touch down yards were 8 to 100.
i tell myself i'm not gonna get into wvu if i don't do something and put some effort in to school but that can't even motivate me
refs get your shit together.. make the correct calls. even th3 announcers are like wtf are these guys doing
@default_user you really are the only wanted stan i have seen on twitter.
the most frustrating thing is when you put your all into something, yet nothing good comes from it

well i think it's safe to say that alabama got this game üò©
so if i do my math right bama is predicted to have 56 and nd 0? huhhah
why isn't awkward onn?
the depressing moment when you google search "how to cheer you up" because the person that usually does is the one that made you upset
all the good people are getting eliminated on the biggest loser..

i'm fucking speechless
the only thing interesting about this game is aj mccarrons girlfriend. hottiealertdissapointedirishfan
when a girl looks bad in her twitcon and so i go though her pics and find out she's actually ugly&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; disappointe
norte done üòû
this is like the ‚Äò95-‚Äô96 bulls vs. ‚Äò97-‚Äô98 nuggets.
if bama duplicates their first half then it will be the biggest beat down bama will have all year. is this really the championship?

i wish i had a iphone 5
congrats to all the cheating reffs and fans of alabama. you have officially made the bcs into moe.

nd just a disappointment right now
theres nothing to look forward to for the next two weeks
this game is not even fun to watch anymore

its like practice to them now
‚Äú@tonyvanetti: i will take nd in a classic ..have faith folks it's alabama and nd it will be a good game‚Äù i was hoping you were right
notre dame can't beat them bitches in flag football
i wish my friends didn't have to leave me :( collegefriends
when people pass all i do is regret i didn't get to see them one more time..

@default_user @default_user  there are spoiler websites unfortunately, since the season is already over  technically :( just saying!
this is an ongoing argument because you have no proof to prove you're right
@default_user i try to look funny but i guess that's not working.

i hate feeling like this.. :/
soo fucking sad cuz tomorrow i have school:s
i had 3 boyfriends in 6th grade and haven't had a single one since
pac is gone and "brenda " is still throwing babies in the garbage.
@default_user still doesn't defeat the fact that ohio state should be in this championship damn
bragging about a 100th tweet or 900th tweet..does that say enough about your life?
these niggas not on the money train i can tell the streets got attention
they've given up talking about norte dame and they're reminiscing on texas a&amp;m's win
okay, i know i don't like nd, but no team deserves this in a championship game..
alabama vs mizzou score: 42-10. missouri played better than nd so far haha.
notre dame is playing like they have no heart.
my usclost to this nd?!
my gummy worms are all gone :(
that sinking feeling of coming back to find your favourite sandwich bar has been replaced with yet another soulless cafe y

rip and much love to the soldiers shot in the drive by right outside of post

now i know why i never bothered to watch the lion king!!
not ready for school
i feel like i am being tortured, by this homework. i just can't get it finished.
find it very hard when this girl hasn't accepted my friend request
the fact that i can't buy @default_user new album because i don't have any money.. üò§ also means i can't talk to them on the phone üò•
gusto ko imnon an yakult ha fridge kaso it's not mine.

best thing about the oscarsso far? using the e.t. music to play out to commercials.

i'm never expected @default_user to post a bath picture on instagram
not knowing if ill cheer in college is the scariest thing
ligit just bawled my eyes out watching the lion king..
turning on the tv to see the lion king is on winning.however not when mufassa is dying is
umm.. all guys now at days say they swagging. when in reality they ain't being themselves..
oi! uso paramdam!
people be saying "i love you" while talking to this person , going with this person and f* on this person..
every 60 seconds in africa, a minuet passes
turning on the tv to see the lion king is on winning.however not when mufassa is dying.

are the oscarsclassy or not? focusing on attracting a younger generation (aka me) does not require tasteless jokes.
